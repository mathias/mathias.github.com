  <p>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on<br />
<a href="http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2007/12/04/fallacy-startups-dont-work-in-the-midwest/">bytecodex.wordpress.com</a><br />
on December 04, 2007.)</p>

<p><strong>(aka I’ll let you know when the Midwest stops sucking)</strong></p>

<p>Well, the title of this blog post is a little misleading: take for<br />
example, <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, which was the shining star<br />
of Web 2.0 a year or two ago, contributed to the further web 2.0<br />
explosion by releasing the Ruby on Rails framework free, and now has<br />
become as ubiquitous and useful as internet infrastructure with their<br />
products Basecamp, Backpack, Highrise, etc. <strong>37signals</strong> is, of course,<br />
from Chicago, Illinois. Further, there are dozens of smaller, successful<br />
Chicago startups that have carved out niches for themselves on the web,<br />
like <a href="http://threadless.com/">Threadless</a>, another Chicago startup that<br />
crowd-sources its products (successfully, I might add).</p>

<p><strong>But the problem I’ve always had is hearing visionaries like <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html">Paul<br />
Graham</a> or Joel Spolsky<br />
saying you can only make startups work in big cities that are “startup<br />
hubs,”</strong> like San Francisco (Silicon Valley) or New York City (where<br />
finance lives). They’re saying that the Midwest sucks too much to<br />
create successful startups. Add Chicago as a “big tech city where<br />
startups work” to the list, and you eliminate everyone in paragraph 1.<br />
Chicago is, after all, a vastly different place than the majority of the<br />
Midwest, both in attitude and population density.</p>

<p>The basic argument has become that some kid from a podunk town in<br />
Wisconsin or Iowa can’t start the next big thing. That’s <strong>complete<br />
and utter BS.</strong> Pardon the expression, but it’s worth<br />
repeating: <strong>It’s BS.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clever heading about why it can work:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The internet is, by design, decentralized.</strong> Judging by the number of<br />
web-workers, co-workers, and freelancers out there today, one doesn’t<br />
need to be in the corporate headquarters to get the job done. The same<br />
goes for startups. You can get broadband pretty much anywhere, and<br />
that’s the only requirement for the startup these days. Everything<br />
else (hosting, support, infrastructure) is all distributed over the web,<br />
can happen anywhere, and is available to customers all over the world.<br />
You could work out of your cabana in the Caribbean as long as you have<br />
broadband, and no one would be the wiser. In connection with this is our<br />
next point:</p>

<p><strong>Technology is cheap and readily available</strong>, too: laptops and servers<br />
(or even virtual hosting) is all the technology you really need. The<br />
cost of startups in this area has dropped to basically nothing. If<br />
you’re really cash-strapped, your hackers probably already have the<br />
desktop or laptop they’ll need to code, anyways. Virtual hosting is<br />
probably the killer app here for startup hosting, with services like<br />
Amazon’s AWS (Elastic Cloud 2 and S3) leading the pack. (not<br />
necessarily in terms of processing power, though.) You no longer have to<br />
spec out several $10K servers and more expensive colo space when you<br />
need to scale your web app these days, you just add more server<br />
instances for a higher monthly fee. (And btw, yes, Milwaukee and Chicago<br />
both have Apple stores to get your hackers their Macbooks.)\</p>

<p>As a corollary, <strong>all the software your startup needs (programming<br />
languages, frameworks, databases, &amp; editors) is available online as<br />
free, open source projects.</strong> If you’re an expert in the technology,<br />
and it lets you adapt quicker and innovate more than a big corporation<br />
could pull off, you’ve can create a better product no matter where you<br />
are geographically. As for your actual web app, you should probably<br />
write it yourself, not outsource it or hire a contractor.</p>

<p><strong>You don’t need a big team.</strong> Have a good idea and a friend to help<br />
you? Good, you’ve got your team. You’re filling all the roles of<br />
developer, graphic designer, systems administrator, management, and<br />
tester. No need for giant developer teams or marketing department.<br />
You’ll hire a lawyer and accountant as needed, but otherwise you’re<br />
set. It’s also possible to outsource all your support in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133/">4-Hour<br />
Workweek</a>fashion,<br />
or otherwise, a FAQ on your site probably does an even better job.</p>

<p><strong>Our cost of living is lower.</strong> If you’re familiar with Paul<br />
Graham’s essay on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/webstartups.html">The Future of Web<br />
Startups</a>, you’ll know<br />
that he’s already made the argument that all you need to create a<br />
startup is a shared space for hackers to hack in, and web hosting. He<br />
doesn’t emphasize having a fancy office, but instead starting in an<br />
apartment or house where bedrooms become offices and everyone lives<br />
together, working day and night towards a common goal of success. The<br />
problem of paying for expensive offices is then lowered. The difference<br />
is that in California (or New York City), the cost of rent is<br />
ridiculous. When success for your startup means just hanging on long<br />
enough, usually only a few more months to get profitable or sell out,<br />
your cost of living is important. So why pay for crazy-expensive living<br />
arrangements in a big Victorian or Brownstone or San Francisco’s<br />
apartment prices? (think $1800/month studio apartments) A team, in say<br />
Wisconsin, working from their cheap apartment can probably crank out the<br />
same kind of work as these startups, for a fraction of the cost. Also,<br />
everything else is cheaper out here, including food, so you can eat<br />
pretty decent if you’re willing to cook and still stay cheap. Then<br />
again, you can still eat only ramen and Redbull if you want to.</p>

<p><strong>You only need an angel investor or two to start, or maybe no funding<br />
at all.</strong> While VCs (Vulture Capitalists) will probably be unlikely to<br />
fly out to see you in farmsville, you don’t need them to start out. As<br />
mentioned, startups are really cheap right now. So the amount you’d<br />
need from an initial angel investor is very low. And believe it or not,<br />
these potential angel investors are all over the place. They don’t all<br />
live in fancy mansions in Washington state or whatever. Even if you<br />
can’t find one, there’s a good chance you can bootstrap your startup<br />
yourself, and then get funding when you’ve already implemented your<br />
million dollar idea and can demo to potential investors, or direct<br />
interested parties to the working web app by handing them a card with<br />
the URL.</p>

<p><strong>With the net, knowledge is hardly geographical.</strong> There’s no secret<br />
tricks known only to a few elite in Silicon Valley. You can have world<br />
class hackers living anywhere and collaborating online as experts in<br />
that knowledge domain. The Midwest can compete in expertise with<br />
anywhere else. We do have smart and extremely talented hackers living<br />
here.</p>

<p><strong>You don’t have to take big risks</strong>, like moving across the country<br />
for something that might fail. While people just out of college, the<br />
typical startup founders, are capable of taking big risks like that, not<br />
everyone wants to. Further, it becomes very costly personally if you do<br />
end up failing and have to move back to Wisconsin with your tail between<br />
your legs. Why not just stay in Wisconsin, see your family on the<br />
weekends, and code just as hard as those guys in Silicon Valley?</p>

<p><strong>The Problems:</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, <strong>you miss out on the tech community</strong> if you’re trying to<br />
do a startup in the middle of nowhere. I’m often struck by how close<br />
and efficient the “web 2.0” crowd is out in San Fran. For example,<br />
watching Leah Culver (of Pownce) give a presentation on OAuth at the<br />
Justin.tv office (despite the fact that we already have two startups<br />
collaborating in this sentence) last week, I realized that planning for<br />
OAuth that didn’t happen over mailing lists or by some big regulatory<br />
committee (cough, ICANN/W3C), but by going out to lunch together,<br />
stopping by offices, and generally sharing the problems they had and<br />
figuring out ways to solve them. You just can’t get that kind of<br />
concentrated knowledge and talent out here in Wisconsin, as awesome as<br />
our tech community is, there’s just not enough of us to make it work.<br />
The community out there is evident when you hear some startup founder<br />
twittering about dropping by another startup’s offices to see what<br />
they’re doing, or everyone is at the same party / conference / barcamp<br />
and the next week they’ve all created something new collectively.</p>

<p><strong>Wisconsin educations are not geared towards creating hackers or<br />
entrepreneurs</strong>. A common argument for startup hubs is that the colleges<br />
there are pumping out lots of very talented kids that are eager to break<br />
into the startup scene. The inverse of this is that, in my experience,<br />
Computer Science students in Wisconsin are getting the exact same kind<br />
of courses, with probably the same level of quality (most likely better,<br />
as you’re unlikely to be getting taught by a TA at the smaller UW &amp;<br />
private schools). But, I get the feeling when I talk to my CSCI<br />
classmates is that maybe they are smart and know “about computers,”<br />
but they’re mostly just gamers or whatever that are in CSCI because<br />
they wouldn’t mind being tech support at a random company, or<br />
wouldn’t mind working on a cube farm for some corporation doing<br />
“computer stuff.” They’re not in it because they’re necessarily<br />
passionate about programming or math or open source or changing the<br />
world. They just want the stable, healthy paycheck from those kinds of<br />
jobs. They’re <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001002.html">the other<br />
80%</a> of<br />
programmers, if they end up programming at all after college. To make a<br />
PG-ish generalization: Serious hackers seem to value their time, and in<br />
Thoreau-ish fashion aren’t willing to trade it for a paycheck if the<br />
work isn’t interesting or fulfilling enough. I should stress that this<br />
is my perception the <strong>majority</strong> of CSCI students I know here in<br />
Wisconsin, but I know a few that are shining examples of Midwest geek<br />
hackerdom. Until we teach the same sort of attitude and expectations<br />
that create Sergey Brins and Joel Spolskys, we’re just making more<br />
miserable Office Space drones who are in it for the paycheck and not for<br />
passion.</p>

<p><strong>Public transportation sucks (aka, distances increase and people are<br />
too spread out).</strong>When you’ve got to drive hours to cross state lines<br />
to get to a BarCamp or ride the train from Milwaukee into Chicago to<br />
catch the Reddit or Google party, you’re less likely to go. So the<br />
tech community is less likely to concentrate in one area for any period<br />
of time, even an evening. Just as a personal example, Milwaukee has a<br />
great professional group for web designers and developers, and their<br />
meetings are less than an hour away if I were to drive, but so far I<br />
haven’t been able to make it to any of their meetings. I’m even<br />
closer to downtown Chicago, but it’s not practical to drive and the<br />
train schedule is lousy at best. Even though San Francisco is a big<br />
sprawling region, their public transportation, neighborhoods<br />
concentrating the tech community, and constant tech events/conferences<br />
trumps what we can pull off in the midwest any day.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-prove-them-wrong">Time to prove them wrong.</h2>

<p>Go out there and make the next big thing. It won’t cost you much,<br />
it’s not risky, and you’ll see your friends and the tech community<br />
every day on Twitter anyways. Work out of your apartment or on your free<br />
time on the weekends. Get cheap entry-level virtual hosting, and see if<br />
there’s interest in your idea.</p>

<p>This is sort of my plan, as I find moving out to California currently<br />
infeasible. It’s uncertain whether any idea will turn out to be the<br />
Next Great American Startup, but on the flip side, you’re just as<br />
likely to fail as your counterparts burning through cash in Silicon<br />
Valley.</p>
