  <p>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on<br />
<a href="http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2007/11/29/jogging-the-memory-with-shoes/">http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/</a> on November 29, 2007.)</p>

<p>Today, I wanted to share my latest little one-night coding project. But<br />
first, a little back story. I’ve been looking for a new Mac OS X GUI<br />
text editor for the past couple of days because TextMate has once again<br />
passed its free 30 day period for me. I don’t mind editing text purely<br />
with keyboard commands in a terminal window, but sometimes it’s nice to<br />
have a mouse and menus when you’re working with chunks of code. I’ve<br />
read studies from Apple that while using only keyboard shortcuts seems<br />
faster, in truth the mouse is quicker at the same task.</p>

<p>On the command line, I’m more likely to use vi than emacs, although I<br />
know my way around both. So when I found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, an “experimental”<br />
Cocoa interface to vim, I knew I’d found my new editor on the Mac. I’ve<br />
already tried all the free editors that worked on Mac OS X in the past,<br />
including jEdit (too slow), Eclipse (really an IDE, and even slower),<br />
Komodo/Smultron/etc., and even most of the for-pay editors (BBEdit,<br />
aforementioned TextMate, and SubEthaEdit). MacVim really takes the cake,<br />
as the vim core understands far more languages &amp; markups than TextMate’s<br />
bundles; it’s as fast as one can perceive a program to be; and it adds a<br />
GUI (gooey!) layer of goodness on top, including tabs, mouse-based<br />
copy/paste/cursor positioning, and a full-screen editing mode to<br />
eliminate distractions.</p>

<p>I’ve also been playing with <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/">Shoes</a>, a framework for making GUI apps<br />
in Ruby. Shoes is the brainchild of Ruby super-hacker WhyTheLuckyStiff,<br />
and I wouldn’t have heard about it without <a href="http://philcrissman.com/">Phil Crissman</a>‘s<br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/philcrissman">twittering</a> about his interest in using it.</p>

<p>The super simple syntax in Shoes lets you lay out GUI components like<br />
elements in a web page, and graphics/animations are easily added. Most<br />
apps are as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>Shoes.app do
  stack :margin =&gt; 10 do
    para "Chunky Bacon!"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But the real frustration is in the lack of documentation. There are a<br />
handle of sample apps on the project’s SVN web repo and roughly 4<br />
tutorials. The full documentation is currently being printed up as a<br />
real-deal book by WhyTheLuckyStiff, and I didn’t feel coughing up the<br />
$8+shipping to get a copy. (&amp; knowing Why, I wouldn’t understand<br />
anything in it anyways). So, I’ve been playing around and doing a lot of<br />
trial and error based on the sample apps to figure out functionality.<br />
Luckily, Quicksilver makes the run-test-repeat loop very tight. (For the<br />
interested, CMD-Space into QS, type “Shoes” TAB TAB, first three letters<br />
of my Shoes’ script’s filename, ENTER &amp; it’s running. Having to launch<br />
the .app rather than calling from the CLI is a problem unique to the OSX<br />
version of Shoes. On Linux it’d be $ ./shoes App.rb )</p>

<p>My first little app was nothing more than adding file saving and opening<br />
functionality to the sample edit.rb script, added color and formatting,<br />
buttons, etc. and then modified it to catch a few more commands given<br />
via keypress. Nothing too fancy, but it was a good way to figure out the<br />
majority of Shoes’ internals. While it was a fun idea to entertain,<br />
Shoes is not the ideal platform to develop a text editor in. Luckily, I<br />
don’t have to, as I’ve got MacVim.</p>

<p>But maybe I could use a little tool to help me remember all the various<br />
vi commands?</p>

<p><img src="/images/shoes-cheatsheet.png" alt="Shoes cheatsheet widget" /></p>

<p>Introducing my cheatsheet widget for vim in Ruby Shoes. It’s based off<br />
the heavy cardstock “vi Quick Reference” sheet that everyone in my<br />
vi-specific CSCI classes was issued (I imagine there’s an emacs<br />
equivalent for classes where emacs is encouraged). Believe it or not,<br />
the longest part of creating this app in Shoes was typing in all the<br />
command hints off the physical copy &amp; thinking up multiple ways to implement<br />
classes containing the data in Ruby. The reinforcement of forgotten vi command<br />
skills in developing this widget in MacVim should be obvious.</p>

<p>Using the drop-down allows you to access such diverse topics as:</p>

<p><img src="/images/shoes-cheatsheet-2.jpg" alt="shoes2.jpg" /></p>

<p>It really does make a nice little app to have running off to the side,<br />
and I’d argue that it was far simpler to create than an Adobe AIR app or<br />
Apple Dashboard widget would have been with the same functionality.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, if suitably motivated I may extend it to read in any number of<br />
.yml files containing ‘cheat sheet’ definitions, and add definitions<br />
from any number of the PDF cheatsheets I’ve accumulated over the years<br />
and never bothered to print out (glancing in my PDF dir, I spy PHP,<br />
MySQL, sqlite3, microformats, and even, yes, Ruby &amp; Ruby on Rails<br />
cheatsheets in there). Using graphics I’ll implement a simple ‘tab’<br />
interface across the top and clean it up so it looks slick. (Red<br />
background when you click on the Rails tab? With little Ruby icon<br />
hovering there? Yes!)</p>

<p>Coding in Ruby is so much fun, it makes trivial things like this<br />
interesting, and Shoes follows in that tradition.</p>

<p>Until next time, happy hacking.</p>
