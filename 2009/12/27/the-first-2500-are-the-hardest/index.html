  <p>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on <a href="http://blog.mattgauger.com/2009/12/27/the-first-2500-are-the-hardest/">blog.mattgauger.com</a> on December 27, 2009.)</p>

<p>Seth Godin is a prolific blogger. He’s also a successful author. When he hit his <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/02/luckiest-guy.html">3000th post</a>, I remember him writing</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hard part, as you can guess, is the first 2,500 posts. After that, momentum really starts to build.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I just started this blog. This is post number 3. And I’ve never really been able to develop a blogging habit. But maybe this time it’ll stick.</p>

<p>Onto the continuing adventures of tweaking this blog theme:</p>

<p>I was in the backseat of my parent’s van after to go to a family holiday get-together.</p>

<p>I had my laptop, and a vague problem of the nav buttons at the top right of the blog being fully rounded in Google Chrome on my macmini. But Firefox showed the nav buttons the way I wanted, with only the two lower corners rounded and a nice squarish block right up to the top brown border line. Luckily, I also had my awesome girlfriend with me. The offending piece of CSS looked like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">border-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="nt">border-bottom-right-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="nt">-moz-border-radius-bottomright</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="nt">-webkit-border-bottom-right-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="nt">border-bottom-left-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="nt">-moz-border-radius-bottomleft</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="nt">-webkit-border-bottom-left-radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>She pointed out that I was using the generic CSS method of rounding the corners, <strong>border-radius</strong>, but also using the Mozilla (Firefox) and Webkit (Safari) specific methods as well for the lower corners. So, I commented out that bit about the <strong>border-radius</strong> and waited, as we were barreling down the highway at 60 MPH in the backseat of a van, and for some reason the Department of Transportation hasn’t started installing free wireless access points on the highway. Which limits my ability to update my blog from the road. Luckily, I don’t find myself in the backseats of vans on the highway very often. (City buses are a different story.) So I uploaded the changes when I got home and tested it. <strong>Success!</strong></p>

<p>Now to move onto some minor <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> effects I want to implement. Nothing flashy, just the Javascript equivalent of hover effects, I’m thinking.</p>
