  <p>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on<br />
<a href="http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2008/03/23/git-is-full-of-win/">bytecodex.wordpress.com</a><br />

<p>The blogosphere seems to be blowing up with regards to the SCM suite<br />
<a href="http://git.or.cz/" title="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>. At least, the blogosphere<br />
I frequent.</p>

<p>git is an open source project started by Linus Torvalds and currently<br />
maintained by Junio Hamano, intended to replace the proprietary<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper" title="Wikipedia - BitKeeper">BitKeeper</a><br />
system that the Linux kernel project used. Like<br />
<a href="http://www.monotone.ca/" title="http://www.monotone.ca/">Monotone</a> and<br />
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/" title="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a>,<br />
git is a modern decentralized revision control system that makes use of<br />
cryptography. The ‘repo’ doesn’t live on one server, instead every local<br />
copy on a developer’s machine is a full repo, with full version history.<br />
Developers initially copy the repo from somewhere (also known as<br />
branching or creating a clone) and make changes locally, commiting<br />
changes to their local repo as they code.</p>

<p>The process of combining two branched repos in SCM is known as merging.<br />
When developers are ready to share their changes, they can ‘merge’ their<br />
work back into other developers’ trees, or others could pull down<br />
changes from the developer’s local repo and work from there. Merging was<br />
previously a time-consuming and frustrating task with other SCM tools,<br />
but git needed to be able to merge the repos of the Linux kernel<br />
developers fast. In fact, git makes it so much easier than previous SCM<br />
tools to branch and merge both local and remote repos that developers<br />
can keep several branches around locally for various changes to live in.</p>

<p>The best<br />
<a href="http://www.mcl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_version/index.html">image I<br />
found</a><br />
to represent this style of passing around changes has nothing to do with<br />
version control, but gives a good idea if you think of ‘messages’ as the<br />
changes:</p>

<p><img src="http://bytecodex.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/adhoc.jpg?w=269&amp;h=184" alt="adhoc.jpg" /></p>

<p>Because all the cool developers hack on laptops now.</p>

<p>Usually while riding on bullet trains.</p>

<p>Subversion &amp; CVS, on the other hand, use a centralized server that all<br />
changes must be downloaded from and uploaded to; making concurrent work<br />
possible. But a centralized server may be restrictive if a development<br />
team is scattered across the globe (as in the Linux kernel team &amp; most<br />
open source projects) rather than scattered across the cube farm. (As a<br />
side note: git does allow for public repo servers, but that is a whole<br />
‘nother topic.)</p>

<p>Best of all, <strong>git is fast</strong>. <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/apenwarr/diary/371.html" title="Blog for apenwarr - Git is the next Unix">Faster than your<br />
filesystem</a>,<br />
in some cases. You can throw data in its repo &amp; <strong>10 years later it<br />
ensures you get the exact same file out</strong>, due to cryptographic hash<br />
checking. SCM tools of years past couldn’t vouch for the integrity of<br />
your files, in fact checking in files was more likely to corrupt files<br />
at some future point, rather than protect them.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go into all the features of git or why it’s faster,<br />
there’s <a href="http://robsanheim.com/2008/02/22/learn-git-10-different-ways/" title="Panasonic Youth - Learn Git 10 Different Ways ">plenty of<br />
resources</a> already.<br />
If you’ve used Subversion (svn) in the past, then <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html" title="Git -SVN Crash Course">this<br />
tutorial</a> is<br />
probably your best bet.</p>

<p>Since this turned into more of an overview of git rather than covering<br />
the two topics I had in mind when I started, look forward to two more<br />
posts this week: one on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, a git repository<br />
hosting service, and <a href="http://atonie.org/2008/02/git-wiki">git-wiki</a>, a<br />
wiki intended for personal use that checks its changes into a local git<br />
repo.</p>
