          Note: I began writing a much longer blog post that went into a ton of detail about how to build an app dashboard that used Hoplon and Castra. The kind of dashboard that just consumes JSON API endpoints from another app or other data sources. Such dashboards update on the...

          Note that this is probably not enough to call a theory. It’s an idea, at most. I’m currently reading the book Race Against the Machine, which describes how increasing levels of automation by technology are related to capital and labor. But this post isn’t about that book. It simply...

          Forming habits is hard. There’s been tons of research on what practices help form new habits successfully. And there has been research on what software can do to help form new habits. It’s not enough to simply send daily reminders or keep track of the goals in a visible place....

The video has been posted to Confreaks, so I’m embedding it here. Also note that I have posted my notes...

        <p>
          When I first starting talking about building a chording keyboard, both in person and online, people began to ask me about the possibility of building a computer foot pedal. With the Teensy microcontroller, a foot pedal would only need to watch a single digital input and output a few...

          Chording keyboards have been a computing peripheral for a long time. They’ve been in use at least since Douglas Engelbart gave what is known as The Mother of all Demos in 1968. Rather than try to sum up the history and potential of the device here, I recommend you...
