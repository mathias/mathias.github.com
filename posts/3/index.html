        <p>
           By "augmenting human intellect" we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better...

          Eli Pariser’s talk, Beware online “filter bubbles” recently hit the front page of the TED Talks website. I found it interesting because it discusses some of what I’ve seen happening online, and some of my fears for how we search and consume content. Watch the video if you haven’t...

As I explained each component: the resistor, the capacitor, the diode, etc., I eventually got to the transistor. I told my neighbor...
