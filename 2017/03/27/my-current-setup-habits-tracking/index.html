  <h1 class="post-title">My current setup: Habits tracking</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>In the past, <a href="/blog/2013/12/28/an-unscientific-study-in-behavior-change-with-software/">I blogged about</a> how I used Lift.do (now <a href="https://www.coach.me">coach.me</a>) to prompt for habit-forming. Learning how to form new habits is one of the key tools to focusing on your growth and the ability learn more. You might recall from that previous post that I refer to the <a href="http://www.foggmethod.com/">Fogg method</a> for behavior change. The three steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the right target behavior.</li>
  <li>Make the target behavior easy to do.</li>
  <li>Ensure a trigger will prompt the behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>So why did I stop using Lift.do? In short, because Reminders.app for iOS and MacOS got better.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reminders_app_example.png" alt="Reminders.app example" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>You may recall that Lift.do emailed me every morning a reminder for one habit I was trying to form: take a Vitamin D.</p>

<p>It’s possible that I could have had Lift.do email about other habits at different times. It could have sent me a digest email of all my habits for the day, each morning. But, sending more emails would quickly overwhelm my inbox and help turn it into the dreaded TODO list.</p>

<p>The prompt or trigger to perform a habit should happen as close to the right moment as possible. With recurring reminders in Reminders.app, I now get notifications for each habit. I can easily tweak the schedule to fit where I think the habit will best fit in.</p>

<p>The notifications show on both my laptop and phone, and I usually have my phone on me at all times. My phone can bug me wherever I am, because I have my phone with me. Completing a task on my phone or my laptop syncs to the other device thanks to iCloud.</p>

<p>As a result, I’m no longer just tracking the one Vitamin D habit. (In fact, I don’t track Vitamin D at all anymore. It has become a real habit and doesn’t need a prompt every morning.) I track 14 habits that happen daily, and an additional 3 that happen every other day or on a custom schedule.</p>

<p>The ease of these tasks varies. Some of them I would do anyways or have already formed habits around. Having the record makes it easier to remember whether I really did them 8 hours later.</p>

<p>Some of these tasks are harder or take more motivation to do each day. I have habits that I’m forming as part long-term learning goals. The easiness of these goals comes having broken it down to tasks that I absolutely can do every day. There’s power in having small amounts of consistent progress every day.</p>

<p>I’d recommend that you think about setting the goal for a new habit to the smallest thing you could do every day. For example: practice for just 5 minutes. Allow yourself to take more time if you have it. If you get to the end of the day, and you’re being honest with yourself, can you fit in 5 minutes of practice before turning in? You will make a lot of progress this way.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-lacking-with-this-setup">What am I lacking with this setup?</h2>

<p>Reminders.app doesn’t really track of the history of checked-off items. It only knows whether I missed a deadline (and how long ago that was) and what’s due today. Items checked off yesterday wait until they’re due today, and then notify me. I don’t have Lift.do’s graphs or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">Seinfield’s “streaks calendar”</a>. But this seems ok. I have a general idea of how well I’ve been doing lately. For longer-term goals, like fitness, I use other apps that have their own “streaks calendar.”</p>

<p>Despite saying in <a href="/blog/2013/12/28/an-unscientific-study-in-behavior-change-with-software/">my previous post on habits</a> that I’ve found progress bars and charts to be motivating, I don’t find that I need those now. Having a list in Reminders.app and knowing whether I’ve done today’s items is enough.</p>

<p>A protip is that you can view all of your scheduled reminders in Reminders.app in a separate list called Scheduled. I keep this list up in Reminders.app most of the time, and use a separate list as a more general/on-the-fly TODO list. I tend to use Emacs’ excellent <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> for my real TODO lists, among many other things. (Org mode does a lot. You should check it out!)</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>This approach triggers habits much more consistently and improves the likelihood that I can get through so many small tasks in a given day. It doesn’t require additional software or notebooks in my process. For something as simple as habit-tracking, I’m not too worried that I’m locked to an Apple app on Apple hardware. This list could be move to something else with little efort, but convenience wins right now.</p>

<p>Overall, this process works for me. And that might be the most important point.</p>
