          I’ve had several Linux laptops over the years, but I haven’t blogged about most of them because I don’t consider myself a hardware reviewer and others typically review laptops much better than I could. I’ve always had an interest in small laptops that I can bring everywhere. My first laptop...

          I’ve now completed a pass at removing the Flickr images from this blog (many of which no longer rendered) and made a few other changes. There were several posts that used embedded Gists as a way to get syntax highlighting and a download link for each file. In the spirit...

        <p>
          In 2021, I decided it was time to build another keyboard. While I am happy with my daily driver keyboard, I’m always interested in trying out new options. Occasionally, I will find myself interested in learning and practicing a new keyboard layout and spend some hours towards getting to a...

          The Elixir community is fast-moving, and there’s always new things to learn. Andrew Summers wrote in to mention a few more tools that I didn’t cover in my Elixir Code Quality Tools blog post: wobserver In my last post, I mentioned Erlang’s observer GUI. The Erlang...

          I participated in this year’s NaNoGenMo, writing a procedural generation script to output a “novel.” This event is inspired by the National Novel Writing Month, in which writers pen a novel in November. I am an avid follower of the Procedural Generation tumblr and I jumped on...

          My Clojure Code Quality Tools post remains one of the more popular articles on this blog. Since then, I’ve been writing a lot more Elixir code. I thought it’d be fun to write a similar post on what to use with the Elixir programming language. By default, Elixir will...

          You might notice that this looks a little different. I’ve switched to a much more modern, cleaner theme for my blog. I’ve also redirected all of the old /blog/ subpaths to their new locations (Sadly, it seems GitHub pages does not support permanent redirects with any sort of...

        <p>
          In a past blog post I talked about the concept of intelligence augmentation. The idea of building software to augment intelligence has been around for some time. That post covers its history more than this one will. I’ve noticed that software developers I know (myself included) will have a...

          In the past, I blogged about how I used Lift.do (now coach.me) to prompt for habit-forming. Learning how to form new habits is one of the key tools to focusing on your growth and the ability learn more. You might recall from that previous post that I refer...

          The introduction to Writing GNU Emacs Extensions introduces Emacs by talking about plumbers. “Plumbers?” you might think. The thing it wants us to think about is whether plumbers make their own tools. Plumbers buy pipes and fittings in standardized sizes. They depend on the International Building Code and...
