    <div class="entry">
        <p>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on&nbsp;<a href="http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/update-2-status-of-this-blog/">bytecodex.wordpress.com</a>&nbsp;on June 3rd, 2008.)</p>
<div class="entry" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px;">
<div class="snap_preview">
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">I&rsquo;ve been away for awhile, and I&rsquo;ve now moved into Milwaukee (well, technically Shorewood, to keep the urbanites happy; it&rsquo;s not quite far enough downtown for them). I should have a new ISP in a week here, but until then, I&rsquo;m writing posts in coffee shops. Which is to say, I&rsquo;m enjoying a lot of coffee, and that&rsquo;s not an entirely bad way to spend time.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The Pirate Bay launched their free WordPress.com-clone service a few months back, with the added promise that they would not censor content as long as it did not violate Swedish law. I set up a blog, at&nbsp;<a href="http://mathiasx.baywords.com/" style="color: #515151; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: silver;">mathiasx.baywords.com</a>&nbsp;and briefly posted there as an experiment, without advertising it much via the usual means. The service leaves a lot to be desired (there&rsquo;s no file/image upload and there&rsquo;s a limited set of themes to choose from, with no way to customize the CSS), but then again, for a WordPress.com clone, it does reasonably well.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The main issue seems to be that only people with Baywords accounts can comment, and I&rsquo;d rather have a way to comment without forcing the user to sign up for any service, perhaps using OpenID to validate identity but not leaving commenting wide open for spam.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">My posts at that blog were quite literally inspired by the main character in Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s latest novel, Little Brother. To that end I was going to write a few posts about some topics one might run into at DefCon, and I made a video of myself nuking an RFID tag in a microwave.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">But, due to the problems with the Baywords service, I&rsquo;ve now abandoned it and left my little experiment there. At some point I&rsquo;d like to pull all the posts I&rsquo;ve ever written from all the blogging engines I&rsquo;ve used (including my own blogging system that I wrote all in one big perl file, circa 2001-2004, with an RDF feed that predated RSS 1.0 spec) into a sort of meta-blog with a huge timeline. Until then, I&rsquo;ll just link things together with RSS glue and pull them into&nbsp;<a href="http://mathias.soup.io/" style="color: #515151; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: silver;">my soup.io tumblog</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">This blog has not been particularly focused enough on code and technical ideas as much as I&rsquo;d hoped, or at least I haven&rsquo;t updated it enough to justify writing much more here, either. So this, too, will get pulled into my soup, and I may post here occasionally, but right now, I&rsquo;m looking to abandon the sort of long-form blog posts in favor of short posts on my soup tumblog and twitter messages.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Thanks for stopping by.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>
<p><span style="color: #424037; font-size: 12px; line-height: 21px;">(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on <a href="http://mathiasx.baywords.com/2008/05/05/your-personal-information-doesnt-belong-to-facebook/">mathiasx.baywords.com</a>&nbsp;on May 5th, 2008.)</span></p>
<p>Today I had to perform a lot of voodoo to delete my Facebook account. They allow you to deactivate it, but they keep your personal information. If you contact them to delete it, they&rsquo;ll try to make you&nbsp;<a href="http://stevenmansour.com/writings/2007/jul/23/2342/2504_steps_to_closing_your_facebook_account">jump through a bunch of hoops</a>.</p>
<p>The steps to deleting your Facebook account, in some definition of the term delete, are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all the email addresses and networks associated with your account, except for your primary email address (the one we&rsquo;re looking to liberate here). Deactivate your profile on the settings page.</li>
<li>create a fake email address on Yahoo (Facebook is pretty good at detecting fake email addresses; they block BugMeNot, mailinator, and every other free-for-spam email service I could find as Google results)</li>
<li>sign up for Facebook with new temporary account</li>
<li>Add your &lsquo;primary email address&rsquo; from your real account to this fake account. The email verification will ask if you want to delete the data in the other</li>
<li>remove the &lsquo;primary email address&rsquo; from real account on your fake account. Deactivate the fake account. Since it was empty, you can also ask them to delete this account in your reasons for leaving.</li>
</ol>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/15/data.security">Cory Doctorow writes</a>, &ldquo;We should treat personal electronic data with the same care and respect as weapons-grade plutonium &ndash; it is dangerous, long-lasting and once it has leaked there&rsquo;s no getting it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say, as consumers and individuals, that we take back what is ours, our personal information. That we insist services delete our user data when we leave, and all the data accumulated from surveilling our every move on their site when we want it deleted. And that we stop being so passive about how and when we allow advertisers and spammers get our attention. Oh, and net neutrality would be nice, too.</p>
<p>Addendum, my comments addressed to Facebook when I deactivated my account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please let us know why you are deactivating.<br />* I don&rsquo;t feel safe on the site.<br />* Facebook is resulting in social drama for me.<br />* I don&rsquo;t understand how to use the site.<br />* I need to fix something in my account.&nbsp;<br />* I receive too many emails from Facebook.<br />* I spend too much time using Facebook.<br />* I don&rsquo;t find Facebook useful.<br />* Other:</p>
<p>A combination of the above really. But to truly understand it, you&rsquo;d have to know me. Actually, isn&rsquo;t that what Facebook is about, you get to know me to throw some targeted ads at me? Haha. Listen, I don&rsquo;t want the notifications. I don&rsquo;t want the apps. I don&rsquo;t want the Google ads thrown at me anymore. I&rsquo;m quitting because there is no reason for Facebook to exist, because you suck up a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=5885">cognitive surplus</a>&nbsp;worse than all the sitcoms and soap operas on television.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t contact me. Don&rsquo;t try to make me happy. Just leave me alone.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2008/03/28/git-is-full-of-win/">Git Is Full of Win</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on
<a href="http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2008/03/23/git-is-full-of-win/">bytecodex.wordpress.com</a>
on March 23, 2008.)</p>

<p>The blogosphere seems to be blowing up with regards to the SCM suite
<a href="http://git.or.cz/" title="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>. At least, the blogosphere
I frequent.</p>

<p>git is an open source project started by Linus Torvalds and currently
maintained by Junio Hamano, intended to replace the proprietary
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper" title="Wikipedia - BitKeeper">BitKeeper</a>
system that the Linux kernel project used. Like
<a href="http://www.monotone.ca/" title="http://www.monotone.ca/">Monotone</a> and
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/" title="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a>,
git is a modern decentralized revision control system that makes use of
cryptography. The â€˜repoâ€™ doesnâ€™t live on one server, instead every local
copy on a developerâ€™s machine is a full repo, with full version history.
Developers initially copy the repo from somewhere (also known as
branching or creating a clone) and make changes locally, commiting
changes to their local repo as they code.</p>

<p>The process of combining two branched repos in SCM is known as merging.
When developers are ready to share their changes, they can â€˜mergeâ€™ their
work back into other developersâ€™ trees, or others could pull down
changes from the developerâ€™s local repo and work from there. Merging was
previously a time-consuming and frustrating task with other SCM tools,
but git needed to be able to merge the repos of the Linux kernel
developers fast. In fact, git makes it so much easier than previous SCM
tools to branch and merge both local and remote repos that developers
can keep several branches around locally for various changes to live in.</p>

<p>The best
<a href="http://www.mcl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_version/index.html">image I
found</a>
to represent this style of passing around changes has nothing to do with
version control, but gives a good idea if you think of â€˜messagesâ€™ as the
changes:</p>

<p><img src="http://bytecodex.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/adhoc.jpg?w=269&amp;h=184" alt="adhoc.jpg" /></p>

<p>Because all the cool developers hack on laptops now.</p>

<p>Usually while riding on bullet trains.</p>

<p>Subversion &amp; CVS, on the other hand, use a centralized server that all
changes must be downloaded from and uploaded to; making concurrent work
possible. But a centralized server may be restrictive if a development
team is scattered across the globe (as in the Linux kernel team &amp; most
open source projects) rather than scattered across the cube farm. (As a
side note: git does allow for public repo servers, but that is a whole
â€˜nother topic.)</p>

<p>Best of all, <strong>git is fast</strong>. <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/apenwarr/diary/371.html" title="Blog for apenwarr - Git is the next Unix">Faster than your
filesystem</a>,
in some cases. You can throw data in its repo &amp; <strong>10 years later it
ensures you get the exact same file out</strong>, due to cryptographic hash
checking. SCM tools of years past couldnâ€™t vouch for the integrity of
your files, in fact checking in files was more likely to corrupt files
at some future point, rather than protect them.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not going to go into all the features of git or why itâ€™s faster,
thereâ€™s <a href="http://robsanheim.com/2008/02/22/learn-git-10-different-ways/" title="Panasonic Youth - Learn Git 10 Different Ways ">plenty of
resources</a> already.
If youâ€™ve used Subversion (svn) in the past, then <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html" title="Git -SVN Crash Course">this
tutorial</a> is
probably your best bet.</p>

<p>Since this turned into more of an overview of git rather than covering
the two topics I had in mind when I started, look forward to two more
posts this week: one on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, a git repository
hosting service, and <a href="http://atonie.org/2008/02/git-wiki">git-wiki</a>, a
wiki intended for personal use that checks its changes into a local git
repo.</p>

<p><a href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/2008/03/18/milwaukeedevhouse1-wrap-up/">Pete Prodoehl has the
scoop</a>.
I donâ€™t really know what to say about it. We all met up at Bucketworks
in Milwaukee with the intent to hack and hang out. I got there at 6PM
and left at around 5:30AM on the next day. It was quite the party.</p>

<p><em>(via <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mattgauger/">my flickr</a>)</em></p>

<p>4braham started a twitter-events mashup project, and I unfortunately
wasnâ€™t much help with it.. I guess Iâ€™m too easily distracted. Other
projects are detailed in Peteâ€™s posts, I was actually out in the
Bucketworks Flow room and so missed most of what went on in the smaller
conference room.</p>

<p>The light table where we did our plotting:</p>
