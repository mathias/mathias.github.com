<p>When you run tests or rake, if you see:</p>

<pre><code>WARNING: Nokogiri was built against LibXML version 2.9.0, but has dynamically loaded 2.7.8
</code></pre>

<p>Then do the following:</p>

<pre><code> gem uninstall nokogiri libxml-ruby

brew update

brew uninstall libxml2
brew install libxml2 --with-xml2-config

brew uninstall libxslt
brew install libxslt
brew unlink libxslt

bundle config build.nokogiri -- --with-xml2-dir=/usr --with-xslt-dir=/usr --with-iconv-dir=/usr
bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Nokogiri should now be compiled against the right version!</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <hr />

<p><em>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/vibura">Coderwall</a> on April 24, 2013.)</em></p>

<hr />

<p>You may be like me and keep a couple virtual machines around on your laptop for development, testing, and gaming. I had an Ubuntu VM in VMWare that I&#8217;d lost the password to, and I wanted to reset it so that I could get back to coding.</p>

<p>Typically, with a desktop computer or a server, you hold down some key while the computer is booting to get into the Grub boot manager and then boot into something called &#8220;single user mode&#8221;, where you&#8217;re able to change passwords, fix configs, repair disks, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the boot screen just flies right by in Ubuntu under VMWare. So the first thing you&#8217;ll need to do is shut down the VM, and then get ready to start it up. <strong>But before you start the VM</strong>: get ready to hit <code>Shift</code> because that&#8217;s what will get you into Grub. Ready? Ok. Boot it and hit <code>Shift</code>.</p>

<p>Now you should be in Grub. If you don&#8217;t get it, don&#8217;t worry, just shut down and try again.</p>

<p>Choose the &#8216;Advanced Options&#8217; and then any of the &#8220;recovery&#8221; lines from the Grub menu for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll get dropped into another menu system. Choose <code>root</code>: this is the single-user mode where you are root.</p>

<p>Your / filesystem may be mounted as read-only at this point. Type this to mount it as read-write:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mount -rw -o remount /</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can reset passwords, etc, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>passwd myuser</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Good luck!</p>

        <blockquote>
By &#8220;augmenting human intellect&#8221; we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by &#8220;complex situations&#8221; we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers&#8211;whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human &#8220;feel for a situation&#8221; usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/03/07/filter-or-be-filtered/">Filter or Be Filtered</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Eli Pariser&#8217;s talk, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html">Beware online &#8220;filter bubbles&#8221;</a> recently hit the front page of the TED Talks website. I found it interesting because it discusses some of what I&#8217;ve seen happening online, and some of my fears for how we search and consume content. Watch the video if you haven&#8217;t to see just how much is already being filtered on the web for you.</p>

<p>Right after I saw the video, of course, <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-to-change-news-feed-to-a-personalized-newspaper/2013/03/07/b294f61e-8751-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html">Facebook announced</a> that they&#8217;ll be rolling out a new version of the the news feed. They are quoted as making it more like a &#8220;personal newspaper&#8221; &mdash; a filter, essentially, for the things Facebook thinks you want to see. As the video above pointed out, they&#8217;ve already been filtering <em>out</em> the things they think you don&#8217;t want for awhile.</p>

<p>No doubt there will be some backlash as people adjust to changes on Facebook, but very few will abandon it. And if you are the kind of person that would abandon Facebook over filtering, or privacy, or concerns about owning your own data, you don&#8217;t have a lot of choices of where to go.</p>

<p>Sure, you can specifically seek out services that aren&#8217;t going to give you a filtered world view &mdash; <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> comes to mind. But that&#8217;s not always possible. The problem is bigger than just the search engine you use and whether or not you&#8217;re logged into Facebook. Just about every site is run by someone else, and they are analyzing you constantly. They are in a brutal battle to keep you as their consumer and keep you from going to other sites. But are the things that they think you want to see what you really want or need to see?</p>

<p>As a developer, I&#8217;m capable of taking matters into my own hands, to some degree. Most of the sites that I use on a daily basis have an API and allow me to export or scrape my personal data. But the cost of switching off of the nice service, the well-designed UI/UX of an official mobile app, and so on has kept me from taking the plunge to export my data and go set up shop on my own version of various web services.</p>

<p>Recently I revamped a very old, empty repo that I had on Github. The point of this repo was code a way to export all of my data from <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>. But for whatever reason the repo has been empty for something like 4 years now. So the other week, I sat down, checked the <a href="http://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm API docs</a>, and wrote a very simple Ruby script to dump out all the JSON it could about my top tracks, artists, and albums over the past 7 years. That script is available as my <a href="https://github.com/mathias/birdsong">birdsong</a> repo on Github.</p>

<p>So far, I don&#8217;t have a real use for the data. I could try to use some visualization tools on it to make cool graphs or maps. Or I could try and get analytics out of it: genres listened to, how they&#8217;ve changed over the years. But for now, I am content to just have the JSON data.</p>

<p>All in all, it&#8217;s around 30 megabytes of JSON data, which is really just plain text with no compression, so it is really quite a lot of data. There&#8217;s more I can do, though. I plan to do to start taking control, to both aggregate my own data and filter it.</p>

<p>For a long time it has bothered me that <a href="https://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> stopped receiving new features, and the features that existed only went so far. To be fair, Google Reader has been a rock solid web service for many, many years for me. It allows me to read my feeds quickly, reliably, and has parsed feeds well &mdash; all problems I&#8217;ve had with other feed readers. It&#8217;s always had some neat features like showing me analytics of what I read.</p>

<p><img src="/images/google_reader_trends.png" alt="Google Reader Trends" /></p>

<p>But as far as discovering new content and helping me to eliminate content I don&#8217;t read or don&#8217;t want to read, Google Reader is not so great. Reader is terrible at suggesting new feeds to read to me; it constantly suggests Dilbert and Lifehacker, and has for the past 5 years or so. I have no interest in either of those. It has never analyzed my reading patterns to such a degree that it suggested something new that blew me away. I am looking for those kinds of interesting suggestions: not just for feeds that match what I already read, but things that are outside of my normal bubble but would be interesting to me.</p>

<p>Luckily, Google Reader has an API, and rather than just exporting my data and building a new service, I can start to build off of it. I get to keep a lot of the features I enjoy while extending it with my own code.</p>

<p>In Pariser&#8217;s talk, he talks about encoding algorithms of filtering and recommendation with a sense of civic duty. To some degree, this means having some journalistic integrity. Such an algorithm needs to present both sides of the story. One issue of many feed readers and other content online is that, well, it only shows one view. The view of the article you&#8217;re on.</p>

<p>But imagine a feed reader that was more like the front page of Google News. It would not only show you the blog post you&#8217;re reading, but all recent blog posts from other authors about similar topics. Maybe, if they&#8217;re responding to a news event or writing about a known fact, the reader could do the work to track down the original source. To take it even further, without even really needing to be aware of motive, politics, and other factors, a dumb feed reader with good suggestions could probably present both sides of the story. Both sides of an argument. Both liberal and conservative takes on the same bill.</p>

<p>Dreaming up features like this can be a deep rabbit hole. Start considering the consequences of pulling up all past articles you&#8217;ve read about similar keywords or tags. Or performing searches for academic papers on the topic. Pulling in data from Wikipedia. Looking up books you&#8217;ve read or are planning to read on Goodreads that are related to the blog post you&#8217;re reading. Or any other number of ways to slice and dice content. And it doesn&#8217;t have to stop with Google Reader.</p>

<p>Opportunities to make better tools and more intelligently consume information are all around us. At the same time, consumer-consuming corporations on the web try to trap us into filter bubbles. They try to provide us with what they think we want, but can they ever really know? In the end, it&#8217;s control-your-own-filters or be filtered<a href="#filter-or-be-filtered-note" name="filter-or-be-filtered-note-return"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> The name of this article was lifted from Daniel Rushkoff&#8217;s <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9408311-program-or-be-programmed">Program or be Programmed</a>, a book which I didn&#8217;t really enjoy. It was not what I thought it would be about: why we should learn to program so that we can control the complex technical systems around us rather than be controlled by them, or how programming&#8217;s problem solving skills can be applied elsewhere. Instead, I found the book to be some technology-fear-mongering and a bunch of diatribes about how things online or in computers are &#8220;less real.&#8221; Suffice to say, I did not enjoy it. <a href="#filter-or-be-filtered-note-return">&#8617;</a></p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I&#8217;ve been teaching my downstairs neighbor basic electronics and how to solder. He&#8217;s a musician and has been working his way through several kits from <a href="http://bleeplabs.com/">Bleep Labs</a>.</p>

<p>As I explained each component: the resistor, the capacitor, the diode, etc., I eventually got to the transistor. I told my neighbor how transistors are rarely used on their own now. The transistors in the kit were there mainly because they were easy to solder, but usually a circuit designer would opt not to use them.</p>

<p>On its own, a single transistor can&#8217;t do much, and takes up some amount of space, which is actually quite large relative to the circuits we build now. I scored bags of hundreds of transistors that were about to be thrown out at the <a href="http://milwaukeemakerspace.org/">Milwaukee Makerspace</a> when we were putting together the electronics lab &mdash; not because they didn&#8217;t work but because that many transistors simply wouldn&#8217;t get used. &#8220;Nowadays, you might as well throw an Arduino in a project,&#8221; was one of the reasons. No one wants to work at the abstraction level of single transistors anymore.</p>

<p>It turned out that the <a href="http://bleeplabs.com/store/the-bleep-drum/">drum machine kit</a> that we were putting together contained an Atmel AVR microprocessor - the main chip of the Arduino. In an effort to save space and complexity, the designers had used a microprocessor instead of discrete transistors. The chip in the Arduino and the Bleep Drum is the ATmega328, which has something like 600,000 transistors inside it.
And I explained how the form factor of the components we were using was obsolete. Even the tight-packed pins of a typical integrated circuit (a computer chip, in common parlance), spaced at 0.1&#8221;, just isn&#8217;t dense enough for modern circuits. The parts we were using were all designed to be soldered to the circuit board by human hands. Slow, error-prone human hands. The vast majority of circuit boards produced today are <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology">surface mount</a>: parts placed by robots and soldered all in one go by another machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really neat that you know all this stuff,&#8221; my neighbor remarked. But I shrugged it off. This knowledge, especially of how analog circuits work and how audio signals are modified by analog components, is mostly obsolete. Better to just use some analog-to-digital converters and put a microprocessor on it. Or better yet, something way more powerful than a simple microprocessor.</p>

<p>We keep putting more and more transistors on a single die, or chip, every day. This trend was first spotted by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, and so we call it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s law</a>. So far, Moore&#8217;s prediction that the number of transistors on integrated circuits would double every 2 years has been quite accurate. It has led us from the simplest integrated circuit in 1958 to the Core i7 processor in my Macbook Air today.</p>

<p>The other day I tweeted about the crazy processing power that we get today under Moore&#8217;s Law.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p>Crazy future; my MBA doesn&#8217;t sweat when running Linux-in-VMware, Chrome, Emacs, LightTable, other apps, terminals &amp; 4 REPLs all at once.</p>&mdash; mathiasx (@mathiasx) <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasx/status/307668858985140225">March 2, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>And in truth, I was running more software than I could fit into that tweet, because I was listening to music, had a few PDFs in the background, and was managing my ebook collection at the same time. But those notorious CPU hogs listed in the tweet should be enough to illustrate just how much is going on without really pushing the processing cores of the Macbook Air.</p>

<p>Remember, my 13&#8221; Macbook Air only weighs 2.96 pounds. In 2005, I had a 12&#8221; Powerbook G4 that weighed 4.6 pounds and had, by my back-of-the-envelope calculations on Geekbench scores <sup><a href="#geekbench-notes" name="geekbench-notes-return">1</a></sup>, my Macbook Air is almost 9 times as powerful as the Powerbook G4 was.</p>

<p>Where is this progress taking us? Well, my iPhone is already pretty powerful. It&#8217;s hard to get a raw number of FLOPS (floating-point operations per second) for the processor in an iPhone 4S, but we can get a Geekbench score for it. It is weighed against the same scale as the Macbook Air is measured on. On that scale, my iPhone measures<sup><a href="#geekbench-iphone-notes" name="geekbench-iphone-notes-return">2</a></sup> very close to the Powerbook G4 I had 8 years ago, but the iPhone has the advantage of having two cores.</p>

<p>Some people incorrectly read Moore&#8217;s Law as &#8220;processor <em>speed</em> doubling every 2 years,&#8221; which it is not. We&#8217;ve found that there&#8217;s more to processing power than just gigahertz, though. The number of cores in a processor, and therefore the number of simultaneous things that a computer can do, is increasing. While there&#8217;s some issues as we grow into this new paradigm where everything has multiple cores and we have to ensure consistency between them, this is overall a net win for those of us seeking more powerful computers.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t really even notice my computer as physical hardware anymore. It is just the stage for software to run on: quiet, fast, lightweight, and very infrequently does the hardware bog down to make me wait. Only a few short years ago, we would have to wait for the computer to do something &#8211; usually shown as the hourglass on Windows and the spinning beachball on Macs. Even things like copying a file between two directories could stop a system in its tracks, and the computer would simply stop accepting any input from the user. Now, processors, RAM, and SSDs are so fast that I rarely have to wait for them. And if I do have to wait, say, for some piece of software to be installed, the fact that the computer is multicore means that I can go and browse the internet in another window without noticing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s likely that, just like the example of VMware running Linux running on my Macbook Air in the my tweet, eventually we will get to the point of having so much computing power embedded around us that we will virtualize everything. It&#8217;s possible that we will take not just files or even processes between computing devices but the whole environment, a whole virtualized machine and operating system. As a thought experiment, imagine pausing a VMware virtual machine while it is performing some CPU-intensive task on your laptop. Now copy that paused VM over to another machine, and start it back up. The software will continue to chug along on the CPU-intensive task like nothing happened<sup><a href="#vm-notes" name="vm-notes-return">3</a></sup>. Advances in processing power, storage speed, and wireless networking speed will continue to progress until this process could be seamless to the user.</p>

<p>In some regards, sending the whole VM across the wire and starting it back up on another processor is simpler than trying to marshal a raw process between two machines, and ensure that the process can still run in the other machine&#8217;s environment. It doesn&#8217;t solve the problem of running one process on many machines at once, but it could be used in cases where we can spin up one copy of a process that we want to parallelize, and then copy that VM to many different machines with chunks of the dataset to process. In fact, that&#8217;s basically how many large distributed processing projects like BOINC (the software that SETI@Home runs on) work.</p>

<p>And so it&#8217;s likely that, for reasons of ease of use, sandboxing for security and safety, and simply because we have so much processing power, in the future our phones and our wearable computers will simply be running a virtual machine. Then we don&#8217;t need to worry about what software is running on our desktop PCs when we get home and have access to a larger display; we just move our processing over to the desktop computer, which ever is more convenient. (Even more likely is that we just have a display that acts like an accessory that we can &#8220;throw&#8221; the video onto, rather than having a separate desktop computer.)</p>

<p>The things around us are getting progressively more powerful by way of cheap, small processors. Where before I was saying that electronics hobbyists would rather use an Arduino into a project than deal with many transistors, industry would rather throw a small ARM processor into everything around us and write software than design a custom piece of hardware.</p>

<p>Case in point, over on the Panic blog, the case of <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2013/03/the-lightning-digital-av-adapter-surprise/">The Lightning Digital AV Adapter Surprise</a>. After wondering why the new Lightning AV adapter for the iPad mini took a few moments to boot up, and seemed to display a scaled version of the video, they cracked open the Lightning AV cable to find: an ARM processor! As far as they can tell, the iPad mini sends a bit of software to the processor in the Lightning cable every time it is connected, essentially booting the cable up, and sets an Airplay stream down the cable to the other end, where the ARM processor decodes it, upscales it to HD, and sends it to the TV. This makes the Lightning AV cable, in essence, the world&#8217;s smallest AppleTV. And we thought the new AppleTV was small when it was debuted.</p>

<p>When I go to a concert now, the room is full of smartphones being pointed at the stage taking video or pictures. And while most people might think, &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of pictures and video that will be uploaded to Facebook,&#8221; I think about the fact that the people in the room with me are holding more processing power in their hands than we had in most of the computer labs in my schools and in college. Those phones will just keep getting more powerful, and soon they&#8217;ll match the performance of the Macbook Air I&#8217;ve got in my backpack. Even the mundane things will have plenty of processing power because it will be cheap and simpler to put a cheap processor in it. But those cheap processors are getting more powerful every day, and that is exciting.</p>

<p>So while I may have learned digital logic in college and can help you build up a simple adder from NAND gates, and as a hobbyist I&#8217;ve learned to build <a href="http://www.geofex.com/article_folders/fuzzface/fffram.htm">guitar fuzz pedals from a few transistors</a>, that knowledge is increasingly obsolete in the face of rapid progress. We will soon be packing powerful processors into everything around us, sometimes in surprisingly ways, simply because it is easier and cheaper than designing a custom piece of hardware. But the future is exciting, and that knowledge isn&#8217;t completely useless, as long as I can share it with a few more people to show us just how far we&#8217;ve come.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Geekbench scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 1,000 (which is the score of a single-processor Power Mac G5 @ 1.6GHz). Higher scores are better, with double the score indicating double the performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scores:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/1713385">MacBook Air (13-inch Mid 2012)</a>: 7675</li>
<li><a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/1545796">PowerBook G4 (12-inch 1.5 GHz)</a>: 861</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="#geekbench-notes-return">&#8617;</a></p>

<strong>2.</strong> Geekbench score for <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks">iPhone 4S</a>: 651 <a href="#geekbench-iphone-notes-return">&#8617;</a></p>

<strong>3.</strong> Of course, there&#8217;s some issues with this. Anything that was happening synchronously would probably failed, as well as anything that depends on a network connection in progress. But for the purposes of the thought experiment, let&#8217;s ignore those problems. <a href="#vm-notes-return">&#8617;</a></p>
