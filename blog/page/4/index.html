<p><em>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/fukypa">Coderwall</a> on July 27, 2013.)</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I wanted to try to implement Minsky&#8217;s Circle Algorithm from the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAKMEM">HAKMEM</a>. As noted in lots of other places online (<a href="http://brainwagon.org/2010/08/09/drawing-circles-ala-marvin-minsky/">1</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3111501">2</a>, <a href="http://cabezal.com/misc/minsky-circles.html">3</a>), the algorithm doesn&#8217;t plot a true circle, but rather a very round ellipse. Here&#8217;s the text from the HAKMEM entry:</p>

<blockquote><p>ITEM 149 (Minsky): CIRCLE ALGORITHM Here is an elegant way to draw almost circles on a point-plotting display:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW X = OLD X - epsilon * OLD Y</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW Y = OLD Y + epsilon * NEW(!) X</p></blockquote>

<p>This makes a very round ellipse centered at the origin with its size determined by the initial point. epsilon determines the angular velocity of the circulating point, and slightly affects the eccentricity. If epsilon is a power of 2, then we don&#8217;t even need multiplication, let alone square roots, sines, and cosines! The &#8220;circle&#8221; will be perfectly stable because the points soon become periodic.</p>

<p>The circle algorithm was invented by mistake when I tried to save one register in a display hack! Ben Gurley had an amazing display hack using only about six or seven instructions, and it was a great wonder. But it was basically line-oriented. It occurred to me that it would be exciting to have curves, and I was trying to get a curve display hack with minimal instructions.</p></blockquote>

<p>The benefit of using this algorithm, at the time, was that it doesn&#8217;t use cosine/sine or any other complicated functions, and so could be implemented on the rather-limited computers of that time to draw circles fast. (I believe it was used to draw the orbits of ships on the early game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar_(video_game">SpaceWar</a>, but I don&#8217;t know that for sure.)</p>

<p>To implement it myself, I needed to be able to plot points on a display. So I turned to Hackety-Hack, which comes with Shoes for drawing graphics. The Shoes DSL for drawing shapes is rather simple, which means we can take the pseudocode above and turn it into a working demo rather easily:</p>

<p>Epsilon is 1/16, as indicated by some quick googling &#8211; basically a small power of two. I have to use the offset to get the center of the circle closer to the center of the Shoes window &#8211; without the offset, the circle will only be a quarter-circle in the upper left corner.</p>

<h2>How does this compare to plotting a real circle?</h2>

<p>If we want to compare the roundness of our &#8220;circle&#8221; to a real circle drawn by Shoes, we can add this line in before the closing <code>end</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Although their radiuses are going to be slightly different.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what we end up with. Minsky&#8217;s Circle Algorithm on the left in red, a real circle on the right in blue:</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <hr />

<p><em>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/vibura">Coderwall</a> on April 24, 2013.)</em></p>

<hr />

<p>You may be like me and keep a couple virtual machines around on your laptop for development, testing, and gaming. I had an Ubuntu VM in VMWare that I&#8217;d lost the password to, and I wanted to reset it so that I could get back to coding.</p>

<p>Typically, with a desktop computer or a server, you hold down some key while the computer is booting to get into the Grub boot manager and then boot into something called &#8220;single user mode&#8221;, where you&#8217;re able to change passwords, fix configs, repair disks, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the boot screen just flies right by in Ubuntu under VMWare. So the first thing you&#8217;ll need to do is shut down the VM, and then get ready to start it up. <strong>But before you start the VM</strong>: get ready to hit <code>Shift</code> because that&#8217;s what will get you into Grub. Ready? Ok. Boot it and hit <code>Shift</code>.</p>

<p>Now you should be in Grub. If you don&#8217;t get it, don&#8217;t worry, just shut down and try again.</p>

<p>Choose the &#8216;Advanced Options&#8217; and then any of the &#8220;recovery&#8221; lines from the Grub menu for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll get dropped into another menu system. Choose <code>root</code>: this is the single-user mode where you are root.</p>

<p>Your / filesystem may be mounted as read-only at this point. Type this to mount it as read-write:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mount -rw -o remount /</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can reset passwords, etc, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>passwd myuser</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Good luck!</p>

By &#8220;augmenting human intellect&#8221; we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by &#8220;complex situations&#8221; we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers&#8211;whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human &#8220;feel for a situation&#8221; usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/03/07/filter-or-be-filtered/">Filter or Be Filtered</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Eli Pariser&#8217;s talk, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html">Beware online &#8220;filter bubbles&#8221;</a> recently hit the front page of the TED Talks website. I found it interesting because it discusses some of what I&#8217;ve seen happening online, and some of my fears for how we search and consume content. Watch the video if you haven&#8217;t to see just how much is already being filtered on the web for you.</p>

<p>Right after I saw the video, of course, <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-to-change-news-feed-to-a-personalized-newspaper/2013/03/07/b294f61e-8751-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html">Facebook announced</a> that they&#8217;ll be rolling out a new version of the the news feed. They are quoted as making it more like a &#8220;personal newspaper&#8221; &mdash; a filter, essentially, for the things Facebook thinks you want to see. As the video above pointed out, they&#8217;ve already been filtering <em>out</em> the things they think you don&#8217;t want for awhile.</p>

<p>No doubt there will be some backlash as people adjust to changes on Facebook, but very few will abandon it. And if you are the kind of person that would abandon Facebook over filtering, or privacy, or concerns about owning your own data, you don&#8217;t have a lot of choices of where to go.</p>

<p>Sure, you can specifically seek out services that aren&#8217;t going to give you a filtered world view &mdash; <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> comes to mind. But that&#8217;s not always possible. The problem is bigger than just the search engine you use and whether or not you&#8217;re logged into Facebook. Just about every site is run by someone else, and they are analyzing you constantly. They are in a brutal battle to keep you as their consumer and keep you from going to other sites. But are the things that they think you want to see what you really want or need to see?</p>

<p>As a developer, I&#8217;m capable of taking matters into my own hands, to some degree. Most of the sites that I use on a daily basis have an API and allow me to export or scrape my personal data. But the cost of switching off of the nice service, the well-designed UI/UX of an official mobile app, and so on has kept me from taking the plunge to export my data and go set up shop on my own version of various web services.</p>

<p>Recently I revamped a very old, empty repo that I had on Github. The point of this repo was code a way to export all of my data from <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>. But for whatever reason the repo has been empty for something like 4 years now. So the other week, I sat down, checked the <a href="http://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm API docs</a>, and wrote a very simple Ruby script to dump out all the JSON it could about my top tracks, artists, and albums over the past 7 years. That script is available as my <a href="https://github.com/mathias/birdsong">birdsong</a> repo on Github.</p>

<p>So far, I don&#8217;t have a real use for the data. I could try to use some visualization tools on it to make cool graphs or maps. Or I could try and get analytics out of it: genres listened to, how they&#8217;ve changed over the years. But for now, I am content to just have the JSON data.</p>

<p>All in all, it&#8217;s around 30 megabytes of JSON data, which is really just plain text with no compression, so it is really quite a lot of data. There&#8217;s more I can do, though. I plan to do to start taking control, to both aggregate my own data and filter it.</p>

<p>For a long time it has bothered me that <a href="https://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> stopped receiving new features, and the features that existed only went so far. To be fair, Google Reader has been a rock solid web service for many, many years for me. It allows me to read my feeds quickly, reliably, and has parsed feeds well &mdash; all problems I&#8217;ve had with other feed readers. It&#8217;s always had some neat features like showing me analytics of what I read.</p>

<p><img src="/images/google_reader_trends.png" alt="Google Reader Trends" /></p>

<p>But as far as discovering new content and helping me to eliminate content I don&#8217;t read or don&#8217;t want to read, Google Reader is not so great. Reader is terrible at suggesting new feeds to read to me; it constantly suggests Dilbert and Lifehacker, and has for the past 5 years or so. I have no interest in either of those. It has never analyzed my reading patterns to such a degree that it suggested something new that blew me away. I am looking for those kinds of interesting suggestions: not just for feeds that match what I already read, but things that are outside of my normal bubble but would be interesting to me.</p>

<p>Luckily, Google Reader has an API, and rather than just exporting my data and building a new service, I can start to build off of it. I get to keep a lot of the features I enjoy while extending it with my own code.</p>

<p>In Pariser&#8217;s talk, he talks about encoding algorithms of filtering and recommendation with a sense of civic duty. To some degree, this means having some journalistic integrity. Such an algorithm needs to present both sides of the story. One issue of many feed readers and other content online is that, well, it only shows one view. The view of the article you&#8217;re on.</p>

<p>But imagine a feed reader that was more like the front page of Google News. It would not only show you the blog post you&#8217;re reading, but all recent blog posts from other authors about similar topics. Maybe, if they&#8217;re responding to a news event or writing about a known fact, the reader could do the work to track down the original source. To take it even further, without even really needing to be aware of motive, politics, and other factors, a dumb feed reader with good suggestions could probably present both sides of the story. Both sides of an argument. Both liberal and conservative takes on the same bill.</p>

<p>Dreaming up features like this can be a deep rabbit hole. Start considering the consequences of pulling up all past articles you&#8217;ve read about similar keywords or tags. Or performing searches for academic papers on the topic. Pulling in data from Wikipedia. Looking up books you&#8217;ve read or are planning to read on Goodreads that are related to the blog post you&#8217;re reading. Or any other number of ways to slice and dice content. And it doesn&#8217;t have to stop with Google Reader.</p>

<p>Opportunities to make better tools and more intelligently consume information are all around us. At the same time, consumer-consuming corporations on the web try to trap us into filter bubbles. They try to provide us with what they think we want, but can they ever really know? In the end, it&#8217;s control-your-own-filters or be filtered<a href="#filter-or-be-filtered-note" name="filter-or-be-filtered-note-return"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

It was not what I thought it would be about: why we should learn to program so that we can control the complex technical systems around us rather than be controlled by them, or how programming&#8217;s problem solving skills can be applied elsewhere. Instead, I found the book to be some technology-fear-mongering and a bunch of diatribes about how things online or in computers are &#8220;less real.&#8221; Suffice to say, I did not enjoy it. <a href="#filter-or-be-filtered-note-return">&#8617;</a></p>
