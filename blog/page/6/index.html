    <div class="entry">
        <p>Aside from being really busy at work, I&#8217;ll be giving three talks at users groups in December. How did I end up agreeing to give three talks in one month? People heard me talking about some topic and they asked me to talk to their group on it. If asked, I&#8217;ll usually agree. I&#8217;m trying to tie them together thematically to make it a three-parter (and encourage people to come to all three meetups) so I&#8217;m calling the series:&nbsp;&#8216;Tis the Season to Write Web Apps, A Three Part Adventure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Development Tools: Git and Github (aka, &#8216;Tis the Season to Write Web Apps Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://web414.com/node/1008">Web414</a></span></p>
<p>7PM, December 9th, 2010 @ <a href="http://bucketworks.org/">Bucketworks</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asked to talk about Git and Github and give a basic intro on how to use it. I&#8217;ll also talk about my developer workflow and technical team collaboration. I&#8217;d also like to point out that&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/ralphholzmann">Ralph Holzmann</a>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;talking about LABjs and yepnope.js after my talk. It should be a great night with lots of technical content!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">PHP vs Rails (aka,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">&#8216;Tis the Season to Write Web Apps</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;Part 2)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.mkepug.org/calendar/15421909/">Milwaukee PHP Users Group</a></span></p>
<p>6PM, December 14th, 2010 @ <a href="http://bucketworks.org/">Bucketworks</a></p>
<p>This talk started as the idea of comparing how traditional LAMP servers differ from how application servers behave. I&#8217;ll be covering Apache and phpmod, some information about nginx, and compare performance. A very basic web app will be used as an example and I&#8217;ll introduce some tools used for benchmarking web applications. Note that the topic has seemingly mutated from &#8220;LAMP servers versus Application Servers&#8221; to PHP vs. Rails, possibly to draw out more folks by using good keywords ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">What&#8217;s new and great in Rails 3! (aka,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">&#8216;Tis the Season to Write Web Apps&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Part 3!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/RubyMKE/calendar/15149551/">RubyMKE</a></span></span></p>
<p>7PM, December 20th, 2010 @ <a href="http://bucketworks.org/">Bucketworks</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be talking about what&#8217;s different in Rails 3 and what stays the same. A perfect follow-up to those that want to know about writing for an application server after the MKE PUG talk. I&#8217;ll have a ported version of the basic web app from the MKEPUG talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All code and slides will be available here and on <a href="http://github.com/mathias">my Github</a> after the talks. I&#8217;ll hopefully have time to put together summary blog posts afterwards, too.</p>
<p>Also: Be sure to join us at&nbsp;<a href="http://web414.com/node/990">MilwaukeeDevHouse5</a>&nbsp;on December 3rd, 2010, 5PM-midnight. The description from Web414:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This will be the first MilwaukeeDevHouse with a purpose&#8230; In the past we just called it a &#8220;party with laptops&#8221; and invited you to come and work on whatever you wanted to. You can still do that, but we&#8217;re also going to focus on ways to make BarCampMilwaukee (and Bucketworks) better.&nbsp;Call it &#8220;Hack the BarCamp!&#8221; or maybe &#8220;Hack the Bucket!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I tend to blog things that I want to remember, but couldn&#8217;t find in one quick Google search.</p>
<p>This is an error I got while starting the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial</a>, because I was using an old system (I counted about 160 gems installed) and starting to use <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a> for managing my Ruby installs, because the Rails Tutorial recommends it. I haven&#8217;t had this kind of issue before, because rails, gem, and ruby commands have all just worked out-of-the-box for me since Mac OS X 10.5 was released.</p>
<p>When I tried to create a new Rails app, I got the error in the title of the blog post:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ rails new first_app
/Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems.rb:779:in `report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem railties (&gt;= 0) (Gem::LoadError)
        from /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems.rb:214:in `activate'
        from /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems.rb:1082:in `gem'
        from /usr/bin/rails:18
minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ rails -v
/Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems.rb:779:in `report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem railties (&gt;= 0) (Gem::LoadError)
        from /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems.rb:214:in `activate'
        from /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems.rb:1082:in `gem'
        from /usr/bin/rails:18</pre></div>
</div>

<p>That didn&#8217;t make sense. Where is the Rails command being run from?</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ which ruby
/Users/mathiasx/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/bin/ruby
minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ which gem
/Users/mathiasx/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/bin/gem
minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ which rails
/usr/bin/rails</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Aha. Obviously the previously-installed Rails gem, from before installing rvm, was an issue. So I figured I&#8217;d just clean it up.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ rvm list

rvm rubies

   ruby-1.8.7-p302 [ i386 ]
=&gt; ruby-1.9.2-p0 [ i386 ]

minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ rvm use 1.8.7
Using /Users/mathiasx/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p302
minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ sudo gem uninstall rails
Remove executables:
        rails

in addition to the gem? [Yn]  y
Removing rails
Successfully uninstalled rails-3.0.1
minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ which rails
/usr/bin/rails</pre></div>
</div>

<p>But I hadn&#8217;t been paying attention. I still had not removed the Rails executable, because I was calling the rvm version of Ruby 1.8.7 and not the system-level one. Knowing that Rails was in /usr/bin/rails, I assumed that the gem executable that managed it would also be in /usr/bin:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ sudo /usr/bin/gem uninstall rails
Remove executables:
        rails

in addition to the gem? [Yn]  y
Removing rails

You have requested to uninstall the gem:
        rails-3.0.0
clearance-0.9.0.rc9 depends on [rails (~&gt; 3.0.0)]
factory_girl_rails-1.0 depends on [rails (&gt;= 3.0.0.beta4)]
suspenders-0.1.0.beta.4 depends on [rails (&gt;= 3.0.0)]
If you remove this gems, one or more dependencies will not be met.
Continue with Uninstall? [Yn]  y
Successfully uninstalled rails-3.0.0</pre></div>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;d finally removed the system-level Rails script and can switch back to using rvm for everything:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ rvm use 1.9.2
Using /Users/mathiasx/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0
minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ which rails
/Users/mathiasx/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/bin/rails
Using /Users/mathiasx/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0
minimite:railstutorial.org mathiasx$ rails new first_app
      create  
      &lt;-- Lots of output --&gt;</pre></div>
</div>

<p>It works!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Always pay attention. The answer is probably sitting right in front of you.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2010/10/16/the-master-s-word/">The Master&#8217;s Word</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Last night, at the opening of <a href="http://www.sector67.org/">Sector67</a>&nbsp;and during a discussion about human language, expression, and the limits thereof, I told a story I&#8217;ve read somewhere, but I cannot remember the source. My details on the story are quite fuzzy; I am quite sure it comes from an eastern oral tradition, but googling couldn&#8217;t help me. Further, I embellished the details to fit in with a story about kung fu, but this story could equally be a Buddhist Koan or something else. Any tips to where it came from would be highly helpful. Without further ado, here&#8217;s my version of the story:</p>
<p>The Master had studied kung fu his entire life, and was widely regarded in the land as the best in the known world. He practiced alone in his mountaintop sanctuary for years, uninterrupted.</p>
<p>A Challenger came, a young upstart who had defeated monks and warriors across the land with his kung fu. He was eager to defeat The Master and take his place as the world&#8217;s best. As he was undefeated, The Challenger prepared on his own, studying defenses against every form and developing his own offensive technique that he believed could not be countered.</p>
<p>Arriving upon the top of the mountain, the Challenger introduced himself to The Master, who remained silent. The Challenger announced his intentions of dueling with The Master and determining who was the best in the land.</p>
<p>The Master appeared thoughtful for a second, then opened his mouth and uttered a single word. The Challenger fell dead on the spot. The Master had condensed an entire lifetime of learning, knowledge, and experience into a single word. He no longer required the movements of kung fu or the physical realm to defeat The Challenger.</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s note: I imagine, in a Buddhist version of this story, the Master has meditated for years in his mountaintop retreat, and instead of killing The Challenger, The Master utters one word and The Challenger is enlightened.</p>

        <p>Seeing this error when trying to run your Rack or Sinatra webapp?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably because you&#8217;re already running something on the port you&#8217;re trying to use. This happens quite a bit if you&#8217;re using daemonized Rack apps that go off on their own after you close the controlling shell.</p>
<p>Use this command to see what&#8217;s happening on a port:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ lsof -i :4567
COMMAND   PID     USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
ruby    74716 mathiasx    5u  IPv4 0x073562a4      0t0  TCP *:tram (LISTEN)</pre></div>
</div>

<div>It&#8217;ll help you see the PID of the process that&#8217;s hogging that port. Just be careful not to kill anything that <strong>should</strong> be on that port!</div>

    <div class="entry">
        I&#8217;ve got text archives of my blog posts going back to about 2008 2007,
so I&#8217;m going to start importing those old blog posts into
[posterous](http://posterous.com) &#8211; **Note: As of April 15th, 2012,
I&#8217;ve imported these all into a new blog on Github Pages running
Octopress/Jekyll** &#8211; and backdating them. Well, the blog posts worth
pulling in. I haven&#8217;t really ensured that the links contained in the
posts work, and the link at the top of each to the original post may
eventually stop working.

Hopefully this mass import doesn&#8217;t screw things up. Apologies if it
does.

Of course, I&#8217;m not pulling in any of the comments, like this comment on
[my old wordpress.com blog](bytecodex.wordpress.com) from [Giles
Bowkett](gilesbowkett.blogspot.com) way back in 2007:
