I've contributed to and built a number of open source projects. I am [mathias](https://github.com/mathias) on Github if you'd like more up-to-date information about what I'm working on.

## My Projects

* [mathias/lore](https://github.com/mathias/lore): A narrative generator library in Fennel. Procedurally generated text engine.
* [mathias/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathias/dotfiles): My dotfiles collection. Reasonable defaults that I prefer.

### Creative Works

* [NaNoGenMo 2017: Destinations](https://github.com/mathias/destinations): A (procedurally-generated) novel about all the people passing through LAX on a given day.
* [NaNoGenMo 2018: The Journal of Alexandria Alexander](https://github.com/mathias/nanogenmo-2018-2): See the [Issue explaining it](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018/issues/101)
* [NaNoGenMo 2019: Walden with word substitution, a Nano-Nanogenmo](https://github.com/mathias/nanogenmo-2019/tree/master/nngm-2019): See the [Issue explaining it](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019/issues/124)

### Deprecated / No Longer Maintained

* [gnar](https://github.com/mathias/gnar): A small Hacker News-like social link sharing site on [Hoplon](http://hoplon.io), ClojureScript, Castra, Clojure, and [HoneySQL](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql). Built in around 8 hours to nearly feature-complete status thanks to the power of Hoplon!
* [hearst](https://github.com/mathias/hearst): Currently a URL normalizer library for some of my other Clojure projects; my goal is to make this a NLP tool like Python's [newspaper](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) for ingesting articles into [remembrance](https://github.com/mathias/remembrance).
* [falcor](https://github.com/mathias/falcor): Metaprogrammed factory-factory in Ruby. Mostly useful as a quick way to create fixtured JSON services.
* [loudspkr](https://github.com/mathias/loudspkr): A dashboard for Bendyworks written on top of [Dashing](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing).
* [hum](https://github.com/mathias/hum): A Web Audio API wrapper for ClojureScript.
* [ecstatic](https://github.com/mathias/ecstatic): a static site generator with modern Ruby tooling.
* [mathias/chording](https://github.com/mathias/chording): My chording keyboard project. Firmware and plans.
* [riffraffle](https://github.com/mathias/riffraffle) A simple Rails-based Ember app for running conference raffles. Extracted from [snow_mobile_raffle](https://github.com/mathias/snow_mobile_raffle)
* [sms_my_bus](https://github.com/mathias/sms_my_bus): a Ruby gem to interface with Madison's SMS My Bus API.
* [gates_of_moria](https://github.com/mathias/gates_of_moria): A simple adventure game to teach the player basic Ruby.
* [zoo_pass](https://github.com/mathias/zoo_pass): a cute little phrase generator for non-secure things.
