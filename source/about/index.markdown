I'm a software developer at [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com) located in Madison, WI.

I have way too many interests. I am interested in functional programming, intelligent agents, and ubiquitous + wearable computing. On the practical side, I prefer to use Clojure & ClojureScript. I've spent a lot of time working with Ruby, JavaScript, and the standard assortment of developer tools: vim, emacs, git, and just about everything else.

A list of the open source I've built or contributed to is on my [Open Source](/open-source) page. All of my work can be found at [github.com/mathias](https://github.com/mathias).

Slides from my presentations are on the [Presentations](/presentations) page.

You can see what books I'm reading over at [my Goodreads](
https://www.goodreads.com/mathiasx). I'm currently working towards a goal of reading at least 60 books in 2014.
