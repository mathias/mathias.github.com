I am a programmer and maker. My interests include functional programming, permacomputing, and sustainable technologies. I've spent a lot of time working with Ruby, JavaScript, and the standard assortment of developer tools: vim, emacs, git, and the rest. I have shipped code in Elixir, Rust, and Clojure, and would do it again.

I work for [GitHub](https://www.github.com). I previously worked at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

A list of the open source I've built or contributed to is on my [Open Source](/open-source) page. My work can be found at [github.com/mathias](https://github.com/mathias).

Slides from my presentations are on the [Presentations](/presentations) page.

You can see what books I'm reading over at [my Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/mathiasx).

### Analytics, Tracking, and Affiliate Links

I have removed Google ads, analytics/tracking, and other external JS libraries from this site. This site still makes use of Google Fonts. To the best of my ability (grepping through source), I've also removed any old Amazon affiliates links that were present in the blog posts. You can [check the source](https://github.com/mathias/mathias.github.com) to verify these claims for yourself.

### Blog comments

I've chosen not to include commenting on my blog. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me at [matt.gauger@gmail.com](mailto:matt.gauger@gmail.com) . Or, reach out on the fediverse to <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@mathiasx">@mathiasx@mastodon.xyz</a>.

### On old blog posts

In the past, I spent time porting all my blog posts from other platforms and blogs to here. It is neat to have 17 years (as of this update) of posts in one place. The old blog posts get cleaned up and I try to do my best to ensure they have working images. Links may be broken due to time and website attrition. I archive them purely to have a single place for all of them, not to represent that my current understanding and opinions match with what I wrote in the past. I had to grow in skill as a writer, and I experimented with a lot of different kinds of content. So reader beware when you go back to read anything older than a few years.
