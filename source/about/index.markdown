I am a software developer. My interests include functional programming, intelligent agents, and ubiquitous + wearable computing. On the practical side, I prefer to use Clojure & ClojureScript. I've spent a lot of time working with Ruby, JavaScript, and the standard assortment of developer tools: vim, emacs, git, and the rest.

I work for [GitHub](https://www.github.com). I previously worked at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

A list of the open source I've built or contributed to is on my [Open Source](/open-source) page. My work can be found at [github.com/mathias](https://github.com/mathias).

Slides from my presentations are on the [Presentations](/presentations) page.

You can see what books I'm reading over at [my Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/mathiasx).

### Blog comments

I've chosen not to include commenting on my blog. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me at [contact@mattgauger.com](mailto:contact@mattgauger.com) (I no longer use Twitter, which is how I previously asked people to contact me.)
