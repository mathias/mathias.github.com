I'm a software developer. I am interested in functional programming, intelligent agents, and ubiquitous + wearable computing. On the practical side, I prefer to use Clojure & ClojureScript. I've spent a lot of time working with Ruby, JavaScript, and the standard assortment of developer tools: vim, emacs, git, and just about everything else.

I work for [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/home).

A list of the open source I've built or contributed to is on my [Open Source](/open-source) page. My work can be found at [github.com/mathias](https://github.com/mathias).

Slides from my presentations are on the [Presentations](/presentations) page.

You can see what books I'm reading over at [my Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/mathiasx). I've got some recommendations for books about [Lisp, symbolic logic, and Prolog](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2450080-mathiasx?shelf=lisp-symbolic-logic-and-prolog-favs) on there as well.
