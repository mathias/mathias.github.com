I am a software developer. My interests include functional programming, intelligent agents, and ubiquitous + wearable computing. On the practical side, I prefer to use Clojure & ClojureScript. I've spent a lot of time working with Ruby, JavaScript, and the standard assortment of developer tools: vim, emacs, git, and the rest.

I work for [GitHub](https://www.github.com). I previously worked at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

A list of the open source I've built or contributed to is on my [Open Source](/open-source) page. My work can be found at [github.com/mathias](https://github.com/mathias).

Slides from my presentations are on the [Presentations](/presentations) page.

You can see what books I'm reading over at [my Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/mathiasx).

### Analytics, Tracking, and Affiliate Links

I have removed Google ads, analytics/tracking, and other external JS libraries from this site. This site still makes use of Google Fonts. To the best of my ability (grepping through source), I've also removed any old Amazon affiliates links that were present in the blog posts. You can [check the source](https://github.com/mathias/mathias.github.com) to verify these claims for yourself.

### Blog comments

I've chosen not to include commenting on my blog. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me at [matt.gauger@gmail.com](mailto:matt.gauger@gmail.com) . Or, reach out on the fediverse to <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@mathiasx">@mathiasx@mastodon.xyz</a>.
