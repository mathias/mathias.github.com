I'm a software developer at [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com) located in Madison, WI.

I like to use the following things: Ruby, CoffeeScript, Rails, Git, vim, and *nix.

I am learning: Clojure, Common Lisp, emacs, and guitar.

My open source code is online at [github.com/mathias](https://github.com/mathias)

I tweet at [twitter.com/mathiasx](https://twitter.com/mathiasx)

Slides from my presentations are on the [Presentations](/presentations) page.

I want to help teach the world to code. And build lots of robots.
