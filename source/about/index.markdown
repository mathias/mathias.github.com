I'm a software developer at [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com) located in Madison, WI.

I consider myself pretty good at (and get paid to do): Clojure, ClojureScript, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, vim, emacs, and git.

I am learning: (more) Clojure & ClojureScript, (more) emacs, [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml), Apache Storm, Datomic, [Android: Netrunner](http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=207), guitar, and ukulele.

My open source code is online at [github.com/mathias](https://github.com/mathias) where I try to push an open source commit at least once per day. You can also check out my [open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/mathias).

Slides from my presentations are on the [Presentations](/presentations) page.

You can see what books I'm reading over at [my Goodreads](
https://www.goodreads.com/mathiasx). I'm currently working towards a goal of reading at least 60 books in 2014.

My interests intersect the worlds of how we learn and how we can use technology to better ourselves as strange cyborgs of the future. The field of intelligence augmentation is just beginning, and I intend to be a part of it. Ways in which these interests manifest include: How we can train better developers through the concept of apprenticeship, how we can build tools that help us to learn and remember (intelligence augmentation apps), how we begin to integrate that software with us in everyday life through wearable computing, and how those intelligence augmentation apps can use machine learning and artificial intelligence to become extensions of us.

This was once the stuff of scifi, but so was a supercomputer in everyone's pocket, once. I studied cyberpunk literature academically, so I know that if we don't build our own future, some corporation will do it for us, and we probably won't like what they come up with.

### My Open Source Projects

* [gnar](https://github.com/mathias/gnar): A small Hacker News-like social link sharing site on [Hoplon](http://hoplon.io), ClojureScript, Castra, Clojure, and [HoneySQL](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql). Built in around 8 hours to nearly feature-complete status thanks to the power of Hoplon!
* [hearst](https://github.com/mathias/hearst): Currently a URL normalizer library for some of my other Clojure projects; my goal is to make this a NLP tool like Python's [newspaper](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) for ingesting articles into [remembrance](https://github.com/mathias/remembrance).
* [falcor](https://github.com/mathias/falcor): Metaprogrammed factory-factory in Ruby. Mostly useful as a quick way to create fixtured JSON services.
* [loudspkr](https://github.com/mathias/loudspkr): A dashboard for Bendyworks written on top of Dashing. Currently rewriting the entire frontend to be a responsive, beautiful system that doesn't look anything like Windows Metro.
* [hum](https://github.com/mathias/hum): A Web Audio API wrapper for ClojureScript.
* [ecstatic](https://github.com/mathias/ecstatic): a static site generator with modern Ruby tooling. Finally released!
* [mathias/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathias/dotfiles): My dotfiles collection. Reasonable defaults that I prefer.
* [mathias/chording](https://github.com/mathias/chording): My chording keyboard project. Firmware and plans.
* [riffraffle](https://github.com/mathias/riffraffle) A simple Rails-based Ember app for running conference raffles. Extracted from [snow_mobile_raffle](https://github.com/mathias/snow_mobile_raffle)
* [sms_my_bus](https://github.com/mathias/sms_my_bus): a Ruby gem to interface with Madison's SMS My Bus API.
* [gates_of_moria](https://github.com/mathias/gates_of_moria): A simple adventure game to teach the player basic Ruby.
* [zoo_pass](https://github.com/mathias/zoo_pass): a cute little phrase generator for non-secure things.
