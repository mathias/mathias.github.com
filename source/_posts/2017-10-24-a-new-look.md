You might notice that this looks a little different. I've switched to a much more modern, cleaner theme for my blog. I've also redirected all of the old `/blog/` subpaths to their new locations (Sadly, it seems GitHub pages does not support permanent redirects with any sort of config file, so the redirects are all in JavaScript.)

Let me know if you notice anything that seems wrong. <a href="mailto:contact@mattgauger.com">contact@mattgauger.com</a>

And if you're curious what this site looked like before the redesign, here's some screen shots:
