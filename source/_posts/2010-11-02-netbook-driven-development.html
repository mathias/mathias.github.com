title: Netbook Driven Development

<p>Recently, there was a blog post shared on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> titled <a href="http://oinopa.com/2010/10/24/laptop-driven-development.html">Laptop Driven Development</a>&nbsp;by Bernard Schaefer. The author is using a 1st gen Macbook Air, which had very limited CPU speed, RAM, and hard drive speed compared to most developer machines. The author explains how he uses the Unix/bash job control commands to pause his editor to run unit tests, and then restart the editor, for example. The <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1855029">comments on Hacker News</a> did not really agree with this approach, and so I thought I'd write a follow-up about this method and share my own development methods. I use a hackintosh Dell mini9 netbook, so I am also limited in similar ways to Bernard. (1.6ghz Atom CPU, 2Gb RAM, 32gig SSD)</p>
<p>The hack on job control does make sense for a machine that's limited by the CPU, if you really are limited by your CPU. I haven't run into a Unix system that was actually slow for years. Even playing with a Beagle board,&nbsp;</p>
