<p>I just found these notes in an old notebook and figured they deserved a blog post . This isn't self-help type stuff, it's just practical. I'm blogging this so that some day I find it when reading my old blog posts, just as I found the list in an old notebook.</p>
<p>Techniques helpful in learning any skill:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your starting point (measure it, somehow) =&gt; "You can't manage what you can't measure."</li>
<li>Set objectives.</li>
<li>Have techniques for improvement available.</li>
<li>Assess your progress after a reasonable period.</li>
<li>Have strategies for continuing improvement and maintaining the skill.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd add in there to have a good way to record your progress. Something like <a href="http://www.daytum.com/">Daytum</a> will probably work if you want a web-based tool. Excel spreadsheets and notebooks work great, too.</p>
