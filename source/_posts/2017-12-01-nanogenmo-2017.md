title: NaNoGenMo 2017
---

I participated in this year's [NaNoGenMo](https://nanogenmo.github.io/), writing a text-generating script to output a "novel." This event is inspired by the [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/), which has a very similarly abbreviated name of NaNoWriMo.

My novel / project is called "Departures and Arrivals." I'd decided to write a script that generated little stories about all the people passing through the LAX airport -- who they were, where they were going, if they were from another country, how they were feeling.

I didn't get started until around Thanksgiving, but that still left me plenty of time for this simple idea. The [dev journal](https://github.com/mathias/destinations#journal) in the README covers the development of my entry in more detail. In the end, I had gathered about 180 lines of data and wrote about 300 lines of code. There's a lot of things I would've liked to improve. In particular, there's not enough variety in the types of stories that the script can generate, and I would've liked to have it decide for some travelers to write small "sub-stories": following a template like "something goes wrong," or "eating at a restaurant," and have it go into detail there. I also wanted to write some code that generated stories for the flight crews (pilots and flight attendants) as well as the ground crew at the airport and the employees of businesses in the airport. I didn't get to any of these things.

The code itself is not particularly spectacular. I chose Ruby due to my experience with it and ability to write out something, and I was able to identify a nice abstraction for inheritance. There's no testing to speak of, but then again, it is just a procedural generation script for an online event and not production code.

Participating this year has given me a lot of ideas about how I might do procedural generation for content better in the future, as well as made me appreciate even more the procedurally-generated fiction/games that I've played. I'll likely repeat this again next year.

You can read my finished novel, [Departures and Arrivals](https://github.com/mathias/destinations/blob/master/departures.md) on GitHub.
