<p>(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on&nbsp;<a href="http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/update-2-status-of-this-blog/">bytecodex.wordpress.com</a>&nbsp;on June 3rd, 2008.)</p>
<div class="entry" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px;">
<div class="snap_preview">
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">I&rsquo;ve been away for awhile, and I&rsquo;ve now moved into Milwaukee (well, technically Shorewood, to keep the urbanites happy; it&rsquo;s not quite far enough downtown for them). I should have a new ISP in a week here, but until then, I&rsquo;m writing posts in coffee shops. Which is to say, I&rsquo;m enjoying a lot of coffee, and that&rsquo;s not an entirely bad way to spend time.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The Pirate Bay launched their free WordPress.com-clone service a few months back, with the added promise that they would not censor content as long as it did not violate Swedish law. I set up a blog, at&nbsp;<a href="http://mathiasx.baywords.com/" style="color: #515151; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: silver;">mathiasx.baywords.com</a>&nbsp;and briefly posted there as an experiment, without advertising it much via the usual means. The service leaves a lot to be desired (there&rsquo;s no file/image upload and there&rsquo;s a limited set of themes to choose from, with no way to customize the CSS), but then again, for a WordPress.com clone, it does reasonably well.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The main issue seems to be that only people with Baywords accounts can comment, and I&rsquo;d rather have a way to comment without forcing the user to sign up for any service, perhaps using OpenID to validate identity but not leaving commenting wide open for spam.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">My posts at that blog were quite literally inspired by the main character in Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s latest novel, Little Brother. To that end I was going to write a few posts about some topics one might run into at DefCon, and I made a video of myself nuking an RFID tag in a microwave.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">But, due to the problems with the Baywords service, I&rsquo;ve now abandoned it and left my little experiment there. At some point I&rsquo;d like to pull all the posts I&rsquo;ve ever written from all the blogging engines I&rsquo;ve used (including my own blogging system that I wrote all in one big perl file, circa 2001-2004, with an RDF feed that predated RSS 1.0 spec) into a sort of meta-blog with a huge timeline. Until then, I&rsquo;ll just link things together with RSS glue and pull them into&nbsp;<a href="http://mathias.soup.io/" style="color: #515151; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: silver;">my soup.io tumblog</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">This blog has not been particularly focused enough on code and technical ideas as much as I&rsquo;d hoped, or at least I haven&rsquo;t updated it enough to justify writing much more here, either. So this, too, will get pulled into my soup, and I may post here occasionally, but right now, I&rsquo;m looking to abandon the sort of long-form blog posts in favor of short posts on my soup tumblog and twitter messages.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Thanks for stopping by.</p>
