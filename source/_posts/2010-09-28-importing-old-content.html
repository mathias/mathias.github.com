title: Importing old content
published: true

I've got text archives of my blog posts going back to about 2008 2007,
so I'm going to start importing those old blog posts into
[posterous](http://posterous.com) -- **Note: As of April 15th, 2012,
I've imported these all into a new blog on Github Pages running
Octopress/Jekyll** -- and backdating them. Well, the blog posts worth
pulling in. I haven't really ensured that the links contained in the
posts work, and the link at the top of each to the original post may
eventually stop working.

Hopefully this mass import doesn't screw things up. Apologies if it
does.

Of course, I'm not pulling in any of the comments, like this comment on
[my old wordpress.com blog](bytecodex.wordpress.com) from [Giles
Bowkett](gilesbowkett.blogspot.com) way back in 2007:
