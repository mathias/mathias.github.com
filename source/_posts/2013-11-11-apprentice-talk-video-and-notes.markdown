Back in September, I had a blast speaking at [Nickel City Ruby](http://nickelcityruby.com/). My talk was entitled "Apprenticeship: Software Craftsmanship's Missing Link" and included a lot of slides of sasquatches. The video has been posted to Confreaks, so I'm embedding it here. Also note that I have posted my notes and a few resources over on the microsite I created for this talk, [http://blog.mattgauger.com/apprenticeship/](http://blog.mattgauger.com/apprenticeship/)
