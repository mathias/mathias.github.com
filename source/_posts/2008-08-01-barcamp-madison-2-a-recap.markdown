(This post is part of my [blog archiving project](/about#old-posts). This post appeared on [bytecodex.wordpress.com](http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2008/08/01/barcamp-madison-2-a-recap/) on August 1st, 2008.)

Had a blog post that I was writing _at_ BarCampMadison2 as the weekend progressed, and forgot to put it under source control. Now it’s gone!

Instead I’ll say that it was a great weekend, I really enjoyed it, and the folks who did the planning really pulled it off! Excellent location, excellent food, excellent people!

My photos from the event are on [Author's note 2015-12-19: Gone from flickr]
