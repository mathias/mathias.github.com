(This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on [blog.mattgauger.com](http://blog.mattgauger.com/2010/01/25/how-does-wisconsin/) on January 25, 2010.)

The title is the question I asked myself after reading through the latest interview at [UsesThis.com](http://usesthis.com/). I'd thought about using the Creative Commons-licensed stylesheets of Usesthis.com (aka TheSetup) for a nicer [About Me](http://blog.mattgauger.com/about) page than I currently had on this blog. After tweaking the template a little, I realized I could use Jekyll and apply this template to any content I wanted.

Instead of just post my own answers, why not interview everyone I know in the tech community here in Wisconsin? So that’s exactly what I'm doing. In the first round of interviews, we hear from [Phil Gerbyshak](http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/philgerbyshak/), [Ashe Dryden](http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/ashedryden/), and [myself](http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/mattgauger/). The interviews can currently be viewed at [http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/](http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/)

There's more on the way, and I'll be announcing new posts through [my Twitter](http://twitter.com/mathiasx) and on this blog. Oh, and please feel free to comment using the new Disqus commenting system!

**Note September 18, 2015:** The site was moved to [http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/](http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/) years ago, but the links in this post were 404ing. I have updated the links above.
