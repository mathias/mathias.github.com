(This post is part of my [blog archiving project](/about#old-posts). This post appeared on [bytecodex.wordpress.com](http://bytecodex.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/programmer-blogs-you-should-read/) on July 29, 2008. I wanted to note that despite being so short, this blog post was both the most read blog post on my Wordpress blog, as far as I know. Most of the blogs listed here are now defunct.)

This is a short list, as I am under the impression that most programmers are already reading [Joel on Software](http://joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/), [Paul Graham’s essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html), etc. Here’s a few bloggers whose writing you might have missed:

*   [Brooks Andrus](http://www.brooksandrus.com/blog)
*   [Gustavo Duartes: Software, computers, and business](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/) – particularly [Lucky to be a Programmer
    ](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/lucky-to-be-a-programmer)
*   [Giles Bowkett](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/)
*   [Code Climber blog](http://codeclimber.blogspot.com/) by Ethan Vizitei

And if you haven’t read it already, you should go back through [Steve Yegge’s blog posts](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/). He’s written some really good stuff.
