title: How to automate package tracking forever.
published: true

<p>If you're like me, you like knowing where your stuff is after you order it. Companies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> make this easy by pulling package tracking right into their Account page. But eventually I get tired of logging into Amazon.com to view my orders, and sometimes I'll order a package from somewhere else that doesn't have Amazon's package tracking functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use this solution, you'll need three things: your Amazon account (or any other online store that emails you a tracking number), a GMail account, and a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.faranow.com/">Fara</a>&nbsp;account.</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> <a href="http://www.faranow.com/">Fara</a> is a great way to track packages in general. But it has two important features that put it head and shoulders above simple package tracking apps for your computer, iPhone, or Android: the fact that you can email anything containing a package tracking number to it to add to your Fara dashboard, and the fact that Fara can SMS or email you updates on where your packages are. Depending on how you like to be notified on your phone, the SMS feature is pretty cool.</p>
<p>The first step in automating your package tracking is to find an email from Amazon for an order you've placed. It can be an order that has already arrived; we're just going to use it to create a filter in Gmail for similar emails. The email you're looking for will have a subject of "Your Amazon.com order of "XYZ" has shipped!" and the fastest way to find it in Gmail would be to search for this string: Your Amazon.com order of * has shipped! from:Amazon</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:FJkDpGdEbypGiHwIIHqI]]Your search should look something like the image above, and should give you some results when you click the search button. Don't worry if you're using the old Gmail theme or a different theme, this will work the same.</p>
<p>Next, click the down arrow next to the text in the search field to expose this form:</p>

<p><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> Fara has some kind of Kindle giveaway happening right now, which is entered if you get others to sign up through your account. I have purposefully not used those links in linking to Fara because I'd rather not seem like I'm getting something for spreading the word about this service. Also, while we're at it: in the far past I experimented with Amazon affiliates links, but I don't use those anymore.</p>
