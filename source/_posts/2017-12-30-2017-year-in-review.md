title: 2017 Year in Review
---

A lot of things happened in 2017. I'm going to cover what happened to me, and not the world at large. The latter seems like far too much to cover and comment on.

First of all, this blog. I had 7 blog posts this year, not including this one. This is far more than 2016, when I published nothing. The [redesign of my blog](/2017/10/24/a-new-look/) took far longer than expected and contributed to my lack of blog posts. It also helps to have something to say. In 2017, I felt like I had only a few ideas worth sharing and very few new projects to blog about.

In March, I started [intaug.org](https://intaug.org) with the intent of coalescing a community around intelligence augmentation. I used the open source [Thredded](https://thredded.org/) engine, which is great. After roughly 8 months, I don't think that forums are quite the right format for this community. I am still experimenting and will likely change the format of [intaug.org](https://intaug.org) in 2018. I appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

I celebrated 3 years of working at Heroku in November. My team is larger than when I started, and I have grown with my team in mastery of our work and problem domains. I'm particularly proud of the team book club and the group learning it has led to.

On the subject of books, Goodreads says that I've read 78 books this year. I had a goal of 100, but I'm extremely happy with that count. I plan to finish up at least one more more book before New Year's Day.

Of the books I read this year, these are books that I'd recommend the most:

* [Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28509312-weapons-of-math-destruction)  by Cathy O'Neil
* [The Grid: Electrical Infrastructure for a New Era](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26073005-the-grid) by Gretchen Bakke
* [Homo Deus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330839-homo-deus) by Yuval Noah Harari
* [Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8306168-dealers-of-lightning) by Michael A. Hiltzik
* [10% Happier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21419710-10-happier) by Dan Harris
* [The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art) by Steven Pressfield

I was lucky enough to travel internationally 3 times this year. Those trips were to Berlin, Germany, Banff, Canada, and Melbourne, Australia. This year also included quite a few shorter trips to places like SF and NYC. It turns out that I enjoy traveling quite a bit, and international traveling is not as bad as I thought it would be. Most of these trips qualify as work-and-vacation trips, not true vacation time. Being able to work-and-travel is one of the benefits of working remotely. But, I've found that it is hard to work with others across hemispheres, such as when I was in Australia. Working remotely from Europe is easier, but I find that I can only work half days in the evenings.
