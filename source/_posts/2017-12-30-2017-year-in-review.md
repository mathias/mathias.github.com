title: 2017 Year in Review
---

A lot of things happened in 2017. I'm going to cover what happened to me, and not the world at large. The latter seems like far too much to cover and comment on.

First of all, this blog. I had 7 blog posts this year, not including this one. This is far more than 2016, when I published nothing. The [redesign of my blog](/2017/10/24/a-new-look/) took far longer than expected and contributed to my lack of blog posts. It also helps to have something to say. In 2017, I felt like I had only a few ideas worth sharing and very few new projects to blog about.

In March, I started [intaug.org](https://intaug.org) with the intent of coalescing a community around intelligence augmentation. I used the open source [Thredded](https://thredded.org/) engine, which is great. After roughly 8 months, I don't think that forums are quite the right format for this community. I am still experimenting and will likely change the format of [intaug.org](https://intaug.org) in 2018. I appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

I celebrated 3 years of working at Heroku in November. My team is larger than when I started, and I have grown with my team in mastery of our work and problem domains. I'm particularly proud of the team book club and the group learning it has led to.

On the subject of books, Goodreads says that I've read 78 books this year. I had a goal of 100, but I'm extremely happy with that count. I plan to finish up at least one more more book before New Year's Day.

Of the books I read this year, these are books that I'd recommend the most:

* [Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28509312-weapons-of-math-destruction)  by Cathy O'Neil
* [The Grid: Electrical Infrastructure for a New Era](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26073005-the-grid) by Gretchen Bakke
* [Homo Deus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330839-homo-deus) by Yuval Noah Harari
* [Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8306168-dealers-of-lightning) by Michael A. Hiltzik
* [10% Happier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21419710-10-happier) by Dan Harris
* [The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art) by Steven Pressfield

I was lucky enough to travel internationally 3 times this year. Those trips were to Berlin, Germany, Banff, Canada, and Melbourne, Australia. This year also included quite a few shorter trips to places like SF and NYC. It turns out that I enjoy traveling quite a bit, and international traveling is not as bad as I thought it would be. Most of these trips qualify as work-and-vacation trips, not true vacation time. Being able to work-and-travel is one of the benefits of working remotely. But, I've found that it is hard to work with others across hemispheres, such as when I was in Australia. Working remotely from Europe is easier, but I find that I can only work half days in the evenings.

## Goals and resolutions for 2018?

I will be tracking them through [org mode](http://orgmode.org/). Much of my life is increasingly held in org mode files. Instead of listing my exact New Year's resolutions for 2018 here, I wanted to share some of my thinking on goals, and what constitutes a good goal.

Consider what habits you want to cultivate. Forming habits, and forgiving yourself when you misstep, are more effective than binary, abstract goals like "get in shape." I’ve blogged about habit-forming in the past. In 2018 I plan to do some more experiments around habits and blog about the results.

Be specific, use [SMART goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). Read up on them if you haven't encountered them before.

Having a New Year's resolution to learn a new programming language is a classic. The book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) introduced this idea to me. But the concept comes from Alan Perlis, who helps us to decide *what* language to learn next with this maxim:

> A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.

Michael Fogus has [written on Perlis languages](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/08/14/perlis-languages/) -- languages that affect the way you think about programming -- in the past. I encourage you to think about what would get you out of your comfort zone. Pick something that is ambitious. Not a language that is another syntax for the same concepts and idioms you already use on a daily basis.

Further, recognize that technical skills are not the only skills of a professional programmer. You must also work well with others. I don't have concrete recommendations here, but there are many places to start.

Find ways to cultivate more focus. Meditation, exercise, and understand flow states. (See: [The Rise of Superman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18222878-the-rise-of-superman) and [Stealing Fire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30317415-stealing-fire) for more about cultivating flow state.)

## Finishing 2017

In all projects, finishing is the most important part. (In agile software development, that sometimes means ending the project early, because you've learned something about the problem or the environment that makes it infeasible or unnecessary. That is its own finish.)

This post is part of my new process for finishing the year: Reviewing what worked and what didn't. I held a retrospective with myself for this. Based on what I learned, I made new goals for next year. I am setting up systems to track new habits and help ensure success. And I am considering what can be reasonably accomplished in a year time scale. Last, I wrote this blog post to help me understand what I accomplished in 2017.

One thing that really became apparent for me in 2017 was that there are always things outside our control. We cannot allow those things to dictate to us, to stress us or cause anxiety. We have to acknowledge their presence but not be controlled by them. While there's a lot of pain and suffering in life, there's also good things. Life is full of things to be grateful for. So, instead of wishing you a happy New Year's, I wish you peace and wisdom in 2018.
