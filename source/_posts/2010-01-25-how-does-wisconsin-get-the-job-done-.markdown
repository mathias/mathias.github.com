  (This post is part of my blog archiving project. This post appeared on <a href="http://blog.mattgauger.com/2010/01/25/how-does-wisconsin/">blog.mattgauger.com</a>&nbsp;on January 25, 2010.)

<p>The title is the question I asked myself after reading through the latest interview at <a href="http://usesthis.com/">UsesThis.com</a>. I'd thought about using the Creative Commons-licensed stylesheets of Usesthis.com (aka TheSetup) for a nicer <a href="http://blog.mattgauger.com/about">About Me</a> page than I currently had on this blog. After tweaking the template a little, I realized I could use Jekyll and apply this template to any content I wanted.</p>

<p>
  Instead of just post my own answers, why not interview everyone I know in the tech community here in Wisconsin? So that&rsquo;s exactly what I'm doing. In the first round of interviews, we hear from
  <a href="http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/philgerbyshak/">Phil Gerbyshak</a>,
  <a href="http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/ashedryden/">Ashe Dryden</a>, and
  <a href="http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/mattgauger/">myself</a>.
  The interviews can currently be viewed at
  <a href="http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/">http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/</a>

  There's more on the way, and I'll be announcing new posts through
  <a href="http://twitter.com/mathiasx">my Twitter</a>
  and on this blog. Oh, and please feel free to comment using the new Disqus commenting system!

  The site was moved to <a href="http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/">http://hackerofmanythings.com/thesetup/</a> years ago, but the links in this post were 404ing. I have updated the links above.
