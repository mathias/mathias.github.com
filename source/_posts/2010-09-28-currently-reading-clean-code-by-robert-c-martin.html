While it comes off as a little repetitive after The Pragmatic Programmer and Code Complete, &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; has a few interesting things to say. I&#39;ll write another post with my notes after I&#39;ve finished the book. The introductory on naming is dated, as most Pragmatic Programmers are no longer naming things with Hungarian notation or individual characters. Given the number of poor naming conventions I&#39;ve seen in production and open source code though, I often wonder whether the made-up statistic about programmers not reading books holds true.
