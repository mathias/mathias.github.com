Recently I decided that it's time to re-read The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson. But, without external motivators, the list of books that I'd like to read grows and grows, and reading books actual takes me a lot longer than it should. (Because, well, the internet is so damn interesting, and I haven't finished reading that.)

So I'm trying an experiment. I am proposing to hold a book club, online, so that I will read The Diamond Age again. My current plan is to use Google Plus Hangouts and hold weekly online meetings to discuss progress in the book. I've never really run a book club on my own before, so we'll see where this goes.

If you're interested, please indicate that interest by signing up below. I'll use the sign ups to plan and gauge when to start.
