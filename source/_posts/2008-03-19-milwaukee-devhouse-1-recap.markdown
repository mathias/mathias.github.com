[Pete Prodoehl has the
scoop](http://rasterweb.net/raster/2008/03/18/milwaukeedevhouse1-wrap-up/).
I don’t really know what to say about it. We all met up at Bucketworks
in Milwaukee with the intent to hack and hang out. I got there at 6PM
and left at around 5:30AM on the next day. It was quite the party.

4braham started a twitter-events mashup project, and I unfortunately
wasn’t much help with it.. I guess I’m too easily distracted. Other
projects are detailed in Pete’s posts, I was actually out in the
Bucketworks Flow room and so missed most of what went on in the smaller
conference room.

The light table where we did our plotting:
