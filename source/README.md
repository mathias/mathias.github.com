This *was* an Octopress-based blog, but I've hacked it quite a bit at this point.

You probably want to take a look at the [source](https://github.com/mathias/mathias.github.com/tree/source) branch.

Also, here's the [license](https://github.com/mathias/mathias.github.com/blob/source/source/LICENSE.md).

## Tips & notes for later

Setting up from scratch, after initial clone (which gets `source` branch). In blog directory:

```
git clone -b master git@github.com:mathias/mathias.github.com.git _deploy
```
